# Fundamental Data Structures and Algorithms

## Introduction

Data structures and algorithms form the backbone of software engineering, providing efficient ways to store, manipulate, and process data. This guide covers essential topics including lists, graph theory, algorithmic complexity, recursion, queues, stacks, and set operations. Each section includes clear explanations, real-world applications, and code snippets to solidify your understanding.

## Lists and List Manipulation

### What is a List?
A list is a collection of items in a particular order. In Python, lists are one of the most commonly used data structures and can contain elements of different types. Lists are mutable, which means their contents can be changed after they are created.

### Creating a List
A list is created by placing all the items (elements) inside square brackets `[]`, separated by commas.

```python
# Creating a list of fruits
fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry", "date"]
```

### Accessing Elements in a List
Elements in a list are accessed using their index, which starts from 0.

```python
# Accessing the first element
first_fruit = fruits[0]  # "apple"

# Accessing the third element
third_fruit = fruits[2]  # "cherry"
```

### Modifying Elements in a List
You can change the value of a list item using its index.

```python
# Changing the second element
fruits[1] = "blueberry"
# Now the list is ["apple", "blueberry", "cherry", "date"]
```

### Adding Elements to a List
Elements can be added to a list using the `append()` method or the `insert()` method.

```python
# Adding an element to the end of the list
fruits.append("elderberry")
# Now the list is ["apple", "blueberry", "cherry", "date", "elderberry"]

# Inserting an element at a specific position
fruits.insert(2, "fig")
# Now the list is ["apple", "blueberry", "fig", "cherry", "date", "elderberry"]
```

### Removing Elements from a List
Elements can be removed using the `remove()`, `pop()`, or `del` statements.

```python
# Removing an element by value
fruits.remove("blueberry")
# Now the list is ["apple", "fig", "cherry", "date", "elderberry"]

# Removing an element by index
popped_fruit = fruits.pop(1)  # Removes "fig"
# Now the list is ["apple", "cherry", "date", "elderberry"]

# Deleting an element by index
del fruits[0]  # Removes "apple"
# Now the list is ["cherry", "date", "elderberry"]
```

### Slicing a List
You can access a range of elements in a list by using the slicing operator `:`.

```python
# Creating a new list for slicing
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]

# Slicing from index 2 to 5
slice_1 = numbers[2:6]  # [3, 4, 5, 6]

# Slicing from the beginning to index 4
slice_2 = numbers[:5]  # [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

# Slicing from index 5 to the end
slice_3 = numbers[5:]  # [6, 7, 8, 9, 10]

# Slicing with a step
slice_4 = numbers[1:9:2]  # [2, 4, 6, 8]
```

### List Comprehensions
List comprehensions provide a concise way to create lists.

```python
# Creating a list of squares using list comprehension
squares = [x**2 for x in range(10)]
# squares is [0, 1, 4, 9, 16, 25, 36, 49, 64, 81]
```

### Real-World Application: Task Management System
Imagine you are creating a task management system. You can use lists to keep track of tasks.

```python
# List of tasks
tasks = ["Buy groceries", "Clean the house", "Finish homework"]

# Add a new task
tasks.append("Call Mom")

# Mark the first task as done (removing it from the list)
tasks.pop(0)

# Display the current tasks
print(tasks)
# Output: ['Clean the house', 'Finish homework', 'Call Mom']
```

## Graph Theory Basics

### What is a Graph?
A graph is a collection of nodes, also known as vertices, and edges that connect pairs of nodes. Graphs are used to model relationships between objects.

### Types of Graphs
1. **Undirected Graph**: Edges have no direction.
2. **Directed Graph (Digraph)**: Edges have a direction, indicated by an arrow.
3. **Weighted Graph**: Edges have weights representing costs or distances.

### Graph Representation
Graphs can be represented in various ways, including adjacency matrices and adjacency lists.

#### Adjacency Matrix
An adjacency matrix is a 2D array where the element at row `i` and column `j` indicates the presence (and possibly the weight) of an edge between vertices `i` and `j`.

```python
# Adjacency Matrix for an undirected graph
#   A  B  C
# A 0  1  1
# B 1  0  1
# C 1  1  0

adj_matrix = [
    [0, 1, 1],
    [1, 0, 1],
    [1, 1, 0]
]
```

#### Adjacency List
An adjacency list is an array of lists. The index of the array represents a vertex, and the list at each index contains the vertices adjacent to the vertex.

```python
# Adjacency List for the same undirected graph
adj_list = {
    "A": ["B", "C"],
    "B": ["A", "C"],
    "C": ["A", "B"]
}
```

### Basic Graph Operations
#### Adding a Vertex
To add a vertex in an adjacency list representation:

```python
# Adding a new vertex "D"
adj_list["D"] = []
```

#### Adding an Edge
To add an edge in an adjacency list representation:

```python
# Adding an edge between "D" and "A"
adj_list["D"].append("A")
adj_list["A"].append("D")
```

#### Removing an Edge
To remove an edge in an adjacency list representation:

```python
# Removing the edge between "A" and "B"
adj_list["A"].remove("B")
adj_list["B"].remove("A")
```

#### Traversing a Graph
Two common ways to traverse a graph are Depth-First Search (DFS) and Breadth-First Search (BFS).

##### Depth-First Search (DFS)
DFS explores as far as possible along each branch before backtracking.

```python
def dfs(graph, start, visited=None):
    if visited is None:
        visited = set()
    visited.add(start)
    print(start)
    for next in graph[start]:
        if next not in visited:
            dfs(graph, next, visited)

# Perform DFS starting from vertex "A"
dfs(adj_list, "A")
```

##### Breadth-First Search (BFS)
BFS explores all neighbors at the present depth before moving on to nodes at the next depth level.

```python
from collections import deque

def bfs(graph, start):
    visited = set()
    queue = deque([start])
    visited.add(start)
    while queue:
        vertex = queue.popleft()
        print(vertex)
        for next in graph[vertex]:
            if next not in visited:
                visited.add(next)
                queue.append(next)

# Perform BFS starting from vertex "A"
bfs(adj_list, "A")
```

### Real-World Application: Social Network
In a social network, each user can be represented as a vertex, and friendships can be represented as edges.

```python
# Adjacency list representing a small social network
social_network = {
    "Alice": ["Bob", "Claire"],
    "Bob": ["Alice", "Claire", "David"],
    "Claire": ["Alice", "Bob", "Eve"],
    "David": ["Bob"],
    "Eve": ["Claire"]
}

# Finding all friends starting from "Alice" using BFS
bfs(social_network, "Alice")
```

## Algorithmic Complexity

### What is Algorithmic Complexity?
Algorithmic complexity, also known as computational complexity, measures the amount of computational resources (time and space) that an algorithm uses as a function of the size of the input data.

### Types of Complexity
1. **Time Complexity**: The amount of time an algorithm takes to complete as a function of the input size.
2. **Space Complexity**: The amount of memory an algorithm uses as a function of the input size.

### Big O Notation
Big O notation is a mathematical notation used to describe the upper bound of an algorithm's running time or space requirements. It provides an asymptotic analysis of the worst-case scenario.

#### Common Big O Notations
- **O(1)**: Constant time. The algorithm's running time is independent of the input size.
- **O(n)**: Linear time. The running time increases linearly with the input size.
- **O(log n)**: Logarithmic time. The running time grows logarithmically as the input size increases.
- **O(n log n)**: Linearithmic time. The running time grows in proportion to `n log n`.
- **O(n^2)**: Quadratic time. The running time is proportional to the square of the input size.
- **O(2^n)**: Exponential time. The running time doubles with each additional element in the input.

### Examples of Time Complexity

#### O(1): Constant Time
An algorithm with constant time complexity takes the same amount of time to execute, regardless of the input size.

```python
def get_first_element(arr):
    return arr[0]

# Example usage
arr = [10, 20, 30, 40]
print(get_first_element(arr))  # Output: 10
```

#### O(n): Linear Time
An algorithm with linear time complexity takes time proportional to the input size.

```python
def sum_array(arr):
    total = 0
    for num in arr:
        total += num
    return total

# Example usage
arr = [10, 20, 30, 40]
print(sum_array(arr))  # Output: 100
```

#### O(log n): Logarithmic Time
An algorithm with logarithmic time complexity reduces the problem size by a constant factor at each step.

```python
def binary_search(arr, target):
    low, high = 0, len(arr) - 1
    while low <= high:
        mid = (low + high) // 2
        if arr[mid] == target:
            return mid
        elif arr[mid] < target:
            low = mid + 1
        else:
            high = mid - 1
    return -1

# Example usage
arr = [10, 20, 30, 40, 50]
print(binary_search(arr, 30))  # Output: 2
```

#### O(n log n): Linearithmic Time
An algorithm with linearithmic time complexity is typically seen in efficient sorting algorithms like merge sort and quicksort.

```python
def merge_sort(arr):
    if len(arr) <= 1:
        return arr
    mid = len(arr) // 2
    left = merge_sort(arr[:mid])
    right = merge_sort(arr[mid:])
    return merge(left, right)

def merge(left, right):
    sorted_arr = []
    while left and right:
        if left[0] < right[0]:
            sorted_arr.append(left.pop(0))
        else:
            sorted_arr.append(right.pop(0))
    sorted_arr.extend(left or right)
    return sorted_arr

# Example usage
arr = [40, 10, 30, 20, 50]
print(merge_sort(arr))  # Output: [10, 20, 30, 40, 50]
```

#### O(n^2): Quadratic Time
An algorithm with quadratic time complexity involves nested loops, resulting in a running time proportional to the square of the input size.

```python
def bubble_sort(arr):
    n = len(arr)
    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(0, n-i-1):
            if arr[j] > arr[j+1]:
                arr[j], arr[j+1] = arr[j+1], arr[j]
    return arr

# Example usage
arr = [40, 10, 30, 20, 50]
print(bubble_sort(arr))  # Output: [10, 20, 30, 40, 50]
```

#### O(2^n): Exponential Time
An algorithm with exponential time complexity grows exponentially with the input size, often seen in recursive algorithms solving combinatorial problems.

```python
def fibonacci(n):
    if n <= 1:
        return n
    else:
        return fibonacci(n-1) + fibonacci(n-2)

# Example usage
print(fibonacci(5))  # Output: 5
```

### Real-World Application: Analyzing Sorting Algorithms
Consider the task of sorting a list of names. Depending on the size of the list and the desired efficiency, different sorting algorithms (with different time complexities) can be chosen.

```python
# Sorting a list of names using merge sort (O(n log n))
names = ["John", "Alice", "Bob", "Charlie", "David"]
sorted_names = merge_sort(names)
print(sorted_names)  # Output: ['Alice', 'Bob', 'Charlie', 'David', 'John']
```

## Recursion

### What is Recursion?
Recursion is a programming technique where a function calls itself to solve a problem. The function typically calls itself with a smaller portion of the problem until it reaches a base case, which is a simple instance of the problem that can be solved directly without further recursion.

### Components of a Recursive Function
1. **Base Case**: The condition under which the recursion stops. It prevents the function from calling itself indefinitely.
2. **Recursive Case**: The part of the function where it calls itself to work on a smaller problem.

### Example: Factorial
The factorial of a number \( n \) (denoted as \( n! \)) is the product of all positive integers less than or equal to \( n \). The factorial function can be defined recursively:
\[ n! = n \times (n-1)! \]
\[ 0! = 1 \]

#### Recursive Implementation of Factorial
```python
def factorial(n):
    if n == 0:
        return 1  # Base case
    else:
        return n * factorial(n - 1)  # Recursive case

# Example usage
print(factorial(5))  # Output: 120
```

### Example: Fibonacci Sequence
The Fibonacci sequence is a series of numbers where each number is the sum of the two preceding ones, usually starting with 0 and 1.

\[ F(n) = F(n-1) + F(n-2) \]
\[ F(0) = 0, F(1) = 1 \]

#### Recursive Implementation of Fibonacci
```python
def fibonacci(n):
    if n <= 1:
        return n  # Base case
    else:
        return fibonacci(n - 1) + fibonacci(n - 2)  # Recursive case

# Example usage
print(fibonacci(6))  # Output: 8
```

### Real-World Application: File System Traversal
Recursion can be used to traverse file systems. For instance, to list all files and directories within a given directory, including subdirectories.

#### Recursive File System Traversal
```python
import os

def list_files(directory):
    for item in os.listdir(directory):
        path = os.path.join(directory, item)
        if os.path.isdir(path):
            print(f"Directory: {path}")
            list_files(path)  # Recursive call
        else:
            print(f"File: {path}")

# Example usage
list_files("/path/to/directory")
```

### Pros and Cons of Recursion
**Pros:**
- Simplifies code for problems that have a natural recursive structure (e.g., tree traversal, combinatorial problems).
- Makes the code easier to read and maintain.

**Cons:**
- Can lead to high memory usage and stack overflow if not optimized (e.g., for very deep recursion).
- Generally slower than iterative solutions due to function call overhead.

### Optimizing Recursion: Memoization
Memoization is an optimization technique where you store the results of expensive function calls and reuse them when the same inputs occur again.

#### Example: Optimized Fibonacci with Memoization
```python
def fibonacci_memo(n, memo={}):
    if n in memo:
        return memo[n]  # Return cached result
    if n <= 1:
        return n  # Base case
    memo[n] = fibonacci_memo(n - 1, memo) + fibonacci_memo(n - 2, memo)  # Store result in memo
    return memo[n]

# Example usage
print(fibonacci_memo(6))  # Output: 8
```

## Queue and Stack

### What is a Queue?
A queue is a linear data structure that follows the First In First Out (FIFO) principle. This means that the first element added to the queue will be the first one to be removed. Think of a queue as a line of people waiting for a service; the person who gets in line first will be served first.

### Basic Operations on a Queue
1. **Enqueue**: Adding an element to the end of the queue.
2. **Dequeue**: Removing the element from the front of the queue.
3. **Peek/Front**: Getting the element at the front of the queue without removing it.
4. **IsEmpty**: Checking if the queue is empty.

### Queue Implementation in Python
Using a list to implement a queue:
```python
class Queue:
    def __init__(self):
        self.items = []

    def enqueue(self, item):
        self.items.append(item)  # Add to the end

    def dequeue(self):
        if not self.is_empty():
            return self.items.pop(0)  # Remove from the front

    def peek(self):
        if not self.is_empty():
            return self.items[0]  # Get the front item

    def is_empty(self):
        return len(self.items) == 0  # Check if the queue is empty

# Example usage
q = Queue()
q.enqueue(10)
q.enqueue(20)
print(q.dequeue())  # Output: 10
print(q.peek())     # Output: 20
```

### Real-World Application: Task Scheduling
Queues are commonly used in task scheduling systems where tasks are processed in the order they arrive. For example, print queues in computers.

### What is a Stack?
A stack is a linear data structure that follows the Last In First Out (LIFO) principle. This means that the last element added to the stack will be the first one to be removed. Think of a stack as a pile of plates; the last plate placed on the pile is the first one to be taken off.

### Basic Operations on a Stack
1. **Push**: Adding an element to the top of the stack.
2. **Pop**: Removing the element from the top of the stack.
3. **Peek/Top**: Getting the element at the top of the stack without removing it.
4. **IsEmpty**: Checking if the stack is empty.

### Stack Implementation in Python
Using a list to implement a stack:
```python
class Stack:
    def __init__(self):
        self.items = []

    def push(self, item):
        self.items.append(item)  # Add to the top

    def pop(self):
        if not self.is_empty():
            return self.items.pop()  # Remove from the top

    def peek(self):
        if not self.is_empty():
            return self.items[-1]  # Get the top item

    def is_empty(self):
        return len(self.items) == 0  # Check if the stack is empty

# Example usage
s = Stack()
s.push(10)
s.push(20)
print(s.pop())   # Output: 20
print(s.peek())  # Output: 10
```

### Real-World Application: Undo Mechanism
Stacks are often used to implement undo mechanisms in software applications, where the most recent action can be undone first.

### Comparing Queue and Stack
- **Order**: Queue is FIFO (First In First Out), Stack is LIFO (Last In First Out).
- **Usage**: Queue is used for scheduling tasks, handling requests in a server, etc. Stack is used for expression evaluation, syntax parsing, etc.

## Set Operations

### What is a Set?
A set is a collection of distinct elements with no particular order. In programming, sets are used to store unique values and provide operations for mathematical set theory.

### Basic Operations on Sets
1. **Creating a Set**: You can create a set using curly braces `{}` or the `set()` function.
2. **Adding Elements**: Use the `add()` method to add a single element.
3. **Removing Elements**: Use the `remove()` or `discard()` method to remove an element.
4. **Membership Test**: Use the `in` keyword to check if an element is in the set.
5. **Length**: Use the `len()` function to get the number of elements in the set.

### Set Operations
1. **Union**: Combines all elements from two sets (duplicates are removed).
2. **Intersection**: Finds elements that are common to both sets.
3. **Difference**: Finds elements that are in one set but not the other.
4. **Symmetric Difference**: Finds elements that are in either set, but not in both.
5. **Subset**: Checks if one set is a subset of another.
6. **Superset**: Checks if one set is a superset of another.

### Set Implementation in Python
#### Creating a Set
```python
# Creating a set with curly braces
fruits = {"apple", "banana", "cherry"}
# Creating a set with the set() function
numbers = set([1, 2, 3, 4])
print(fruits)  # Output: {'apple', 'banana', 'cherry'}
print(numbers)  # Output: {1, 2, 3, 4}
```

#### Adding and Removing Elements
```python
# Adding an element
fruits.add("orange")
print(fruits)  # Output: {'apple', 'banana', 'cherry', 'orange'}

# Removing an element
fruits.remove("banana")
print(fruits)  # Output: {'apple', 'cherry', 'orange'}

# Discarding an element (does not raise an error if element is not present)
fruits.discard("banana")
print(fruits)  # Output: {'apple', 'cherry', 'orange'}
```

#### Membership Test and Length
```python
print("apple" in fruits)  # Output: True
print(len(fruits))  # Output: 3
```

#### Union, Intersection, Difference, Symmetric Difference
```python
set1 = {1, 2, 3, 4}
set2 = {3, 4, 5, 6}

# Union
union_set = set1.union(set2)
print(union_set)  # Output: {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6}

# Intersection
intersection_set = set1.intersection(set2)
print(intersection_set)  # Output: {3, 4}

# Difference
difference_set = set1.difference(set2)
print(difference_set)  # Output: {1, 2}

# Symmetric Difference
sym_diff_set = set1.symmetric_difference(set2)
print(sym_diff_set)  # Output: {1, 2, 5, 6}
```

#### Subset and Superset
```python
subset = {1, 2}
print(subset.issubset(set1))  # Output: True
print(set1.issuperset(subset))  # Output: True
```

### Real-World Application: Removing Duplicates
Sets are useful for removing duplicates from a list. For example, to get unique email addresses from a list of emails:
```python
emails = ["test@example.com", "user@example.com", "test@example.com"]
unique_emails = set(emails)
print(unique_emails)  # Output: {'test@example.com', 'user@example.com'}
```
