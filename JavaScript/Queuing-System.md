# Running a Redis Server on Your Machine

## Introduction to Redis
Redis is an open-source, in-memory data structure store that can be used as a database, cache, and message broker. It's known for its speed and flexibility in storing data in different formats like strings, hashes, lists, sets, and more.

## Objectives
By the end of this guide, you should be able to:
1. Understand what Redis is and its use cases.
2. Install Redis on your machine.
3. Start and stop the Redis server.
4. Use basic Redis commands to interact with the server.

## Installing Redis
### On Windows
1. **Download Redis**: Visit the [Redis download page](https://redis.io/download) and download the Redis package for Windows.
2. **Extract and Install**: Extract the downloaded file and follow the installation instructions. Typically, you will need to run an installer file.
3. **Verify Installation**: Open Command Prompt and type `redis-server`. If Redis starts, the installation was successful.

### On macOS
1. **Install Homebrew**: If you don't have Homebrew installed, open Terminal and run:
   ```bash
   /bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"
   ```
2. **Install Redis**: With Homebrew installed, you can easily install Redis by running:
   ```bash
   brew install redis
   ```
3. **Start Redis**: Start the Redis server with:
   ```bash
   brew services start redis
   ```
4. **Verify Installation**: Check if Redis is running by typing `redis-cli ping` in the Terminal. You should see "PONG" as a response.

### On Linux
1. **Update Package Index**: Open Terminal and update your package index by running:
   ```bash
   sudo apt update
   ```
2. **Install Redis**: Install Redis with:
   ```bash
   sudo apt install redis-server
   ```
3. **Start Redis**: Start the Redis service with:
   ```bash
   sudo systemctl start redis
   ```
4. **Verify Installation**: Check if Redis is running by using `redis-cli ping`. You should receive a "PONG" response.

## Running and Stopping the Redis Server
### Starting Redis
To start the Redis server, simply run:
```bash
redis-server
```
This command starts Redis with the default configuration. If you want to specify a configuration file, you can use:
```bash
redis-server /path/to/redis.conf
```

### Stopping Redis
To stop the Redis server, you can either:
1. Press `Ctrl+C` in the terminal where the server is running.
2. Use the shutdown command in the Redis CLI:
   ```bash
   redis-cli shutdown
   ```

## Basic Redis Commands
Once your Redis server is running, you can interact with it using the Redis CLI (Command Line Interface). Here are some basic commands:

1. **Set a Key-Value Pair**:
   ```bash
   SET key value
   ```
   Example:
   ```bash
   SET name "John"
   ```

2. **Get a Value by Key**:
   ```bash
   GET key
   ```
   Example:
   ```bash
   GET name
   ```
   Output: "John"

3. **Check if a Key Exists**:
   ```bash
   EXISTS key
   ```
   Example:
   ```bash
   EXISTS name
   ```
   Output: (integer) 1

4. **Delete a Key**:
   ```bash
   DEL key
   ```
   Example:
   ```bash
   DEL name
   ```

5. **List All Keys**:
   ```bash
   KEYS *
   ```
   This command lists all the keys stored in the Redis database.

## Real-World Application
Redis is widely used in real-world projects for various purposes:
- **Caching**: Store frequently accessed data to reduce database load.
- **Session Management**: Store user session data in web applications.
- **Message Queue**: Use Redis as a broker for handling real-time messaging and task queues.

For instance, if you have a web application where users frequently access certain product details, you can cache these details in Redis to reduce the load on your primary database.

# Running Simple Operations with the Redis Client

## Introduction to Redis Client
The Redis client, known as `redis-cli`, is a command-line interface that allows you to interact with a Redis server. It enables you to perform various operations like setting, getting, and managing data stored in Redis. Understanding how to use the Redis client is essential for managing data in a Redis database.

## Objectives
By the end of this guide, you should be able to:
1. Use the Redis client to connect to a Redis server.
2. Perform basic CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations.
3. Apply these operations in real-world scenarios.

## Connecting to a Redis Server
To use the Redis client, you need to connect it to a running Redis server. By default, Redis runs on `localhost` (127.0.0.1) and port `6379`. You can connect using the following command:
```bash
redis-cli
```
Once connected, you can start executing commands.

## Basic CRUD Operations

### 1. **Setting Data (Create/Update)**
The `SET` command is used to store a value with a specific key. If the key already exists, it updates the value.
```bash
SET key value
```
**Example:**
```bash
SET username "alice"
```
This stores the value "alice" with the key "username".

### 2. **Getting Data (Read)**
The `GET` command retrieves the value associated with a given key.
```bash
GET key
```
**Example:**
```bash
GET username
```
This returns the value "alice".

### 3. **Checking Key Existence**
To check if a key exists in the database, use the `EXISTS` command.
```bash
EXISTS key
```
**Example:**
```bash
EXISTS username
```
Returns `(integer) 1` if the key exists, `(integer) 0` if it doesn't.

### 4. **Deleting Data (Delete)**
The `DEL` command deletes the key-value pair associated with a given key.
```bash
DEL key
```
**Example:**
```bash
DEL username
```
This deletes the key "username" and its associated value.

### 5. **Listing All Keys**
To see all keys stored in Redis, use the `KEYS` command with a pattern.
```bash
KEYS pattern
```
**Example:**
```bash
KEYS *
```
This lists all keys in the database.

### 6. **Incrementing and Decrementing Values**
Redis provides commands to increment or decrement numeric values stored as strings.
- **Incrementing:** `INCR key`
- **Decrementing:** `DECR key`

**Example:**
```bash
SET score 10
INCR score
```
The `score` key's value will be incremented from 10 to 11.

## Real-World Application
In real-world projects, Redis can be used for:
- **Session Management:** Storing user sessions and authentication data.
- **Caching:** Reducing database load by caching frequently accessed data.
- **Analytics:** Storing counters and metrics for tracking user interactions.

For example, in an e-commerce application, Redis can be used to cache product information, reducing the load on the main database and improving page load times.

# Using Redis Client with Node.js for Basic Operations

## Introduction to Redis and Node.js
Redis is an in-memory data structure store commonly used as a database, cache, and message broker. Node.js is a popular JavaScript runtime that allows developers to build scalable network applications. Using Redis with Node.js enables efficient handling of data, especially for high-performance applications.

## Objectives
By the end of this guide, you should be able to:
1. Set up a Redis client in a Node.js environment.
2. Perform basic CRUD operations using Redis commands in Node.js.
3. Apply these operations in real-world scenarios, such as caching and session management.

## Setting Up Redis Client in Node.js
### Installing Required Packages
To interact with Redis from Node.js, you need to install the `redis` package. Use the following command to install it:
```bash
npm install redis
```

### Connecting to Redis
To connect to a Redis server from your Node.js application, you first require the `redis` module and then create a client.
```javascript
const redis = require('redis');
const client = redis.createClient({
  host: '127.0.0.1', // Default host
  port: 6379        // Default port
});

client.on('connect', () => {
  console.log('Connected to Redis');
});

client.on('error', (err) => {
  console.log('Redis error: ' + err);
});
```
This code sets up a connection to a Redis server running on the local machine.

## Basic Operations

### 1. **Setting Data**
To store a key-value pair in Redis, use the `set` method.
```javascript
client.set('name', 'Alice', (err, reply) => {
  if (err) throw err;
  console.log(reply); // Output: OK
});
```
This sets the value 'Alice' for the key 'name'.

### 2. **Getting Data**
To retrieve the value associated with a key, use the `get` method.
```javascript
client.get('name', (err, reply) => {
  if (err) throw err;
  console.log(reply); // Output: Alice
});
```

### 3. **Checking if a Key Exists**
Use the `exists` method to check if a key exists.
```javascript
client.exists('name', (err, reply) => {
  if (err) throw err;
  console.log(reply); // Output: 1 if exists, 0 if not
});
```

### 4. **Deleting Data**
To delete a key-value pair, use the `del` method.
```javascript
client.del('name', (err, reply) => {
  if (err) throw err;
  console.log(reply); // Output: 1 if key was deleted, 0 if not found
});
```

### 5. **Incrementing and Decrementing Values**
These operations are useful for counters. Use `incr` to increment and `decr` to decrement a value.
```javascript
client.set('count', 0);
client.incr('count', (err, reply) => {
  if (err) throw err;
  console.log(reply); // Output: 1
});

client.decr('count', (err, reply) => {
  if (err) throw err;
  console.log(reply); // Output: 0
});
```

## Real-World Application
Using Redis with Node.js is particularly beneficial for:
- **Caching**: Store frequently accessed data to reduce database load and improve response times.
- **Session Management**: Store user session data in Redis for quick access and management.
- **Counters and Analytics**: Track page views, likes, or other metrics with Redis' atomic increment and decrement operations.

For example, in a web application, you can cache user profile information in Redis to quickly serve profile pages without querying the database each time.

# Storing Hash Values in Redis

## Introduction to Redis Hashes
Redis is an in-memory data structure store that supports various data types, including strings, lists, sets, and hashes. Hashes in Redis are maps between string fields and string values, making them perfect for representing objects with multiple properties.

## Objectives
By the end of this guide, you should be able to:
1. Understand what Redis hashes are and their use cases.
2. Store and retrieve hash values in Redis.
3. Apply these concepts in real-world scenarios.

## Working with Redis Hashes

### What is a Redis Hash?
A Redis hash is a data type that allows you to store multiple field-value pairs under a single key. It is like a dictionary or an object in programming, where each field is a unique key, and its corresponding value can be a string.

### Storing Hash Values

#### **Setting a Field in a Hash**
To set a field in a hash, use the `HSET` command. This command requires the name of the hash, the field, and the value.
```bash
HSET hash_name field value
```
**Example:**
```bash
HSET user:1001 name "Alice"
HSET user:1001 age "30"
HSET user:1001 email "alice@example.com"
```
This creates a hash with the key `user:1001` and fields `name`, `age`, and `email`.

#### **Setting Multiple Fields at Once**
You can set multiple fields in a hash at once using the `HMSET` command.
```bash
HMSET hash_name field1 value1 field2 value2 ...
```
**Example:**
```bash
HMSET user:1002 name "Bob" age "25" email "bob@example.com"
```

### Retrieving Hash Values

#### **Getting a Single Field Value**
To get the value of a single field, use the `HGET` command.
```bash
HGET hash_name field
```
**Example:**
```bash
HGET user:1001 name
```
This retrieves the value "Alice".

#### **Getting All Fields and Values**
To retrieve all the fields and values in a hash, use the `HGETALL` command.
```bash
HGETALL hash_name
```
**Example:**
```bash
HGETALL user:1001
```
This returns all fields and their values:
```
1) "name"
2) "Alice"
3) "age"
4) "30"
5) "email"
6) "alice@example.com"
```

#### **Getting Multiple Field Values**
To get values for multiple fields, use the `HMGET` command.
```bash
HMGET hash_name field1 field2 ...
```
**Example:**
```bash
HMGET user:1001 name age
```
This retrieves the values "Alice" and "30".

### Deleting Fields and Hashes

#### **Deleting a Field**
To delete a specific field from a hash, use the `HDEL` command.
```bash
HDEL hash_name field
```
**Example:**
```bash
HDEL user:1001 age
```
This deletes the field `age` from the hash `user:1001`.

#### **Deleting a Hash**
To delete an entire hash, use the `DEL` command, as hashes are just a type of key.
```bash
DEL hash_name
```
**Example:**
```bash
DEL user:1001
```

## Real-World Application
Hashes are useful in many real-world scenarios:
- **User Profiles:** Store user data such as names, email addresses, and preferences.
- **Product Information:** Manage product details like name, price, and inventory in e-commerce applications.
- **Configuration Settings:** Store and quickly access configuration parameters.

For instance, in a web application, you can use Redis hashes to store and quickly retrieve user profile information, reducing the need for multiple database queries.

# Handling Asynchronous Operations with Redis

## Introduction to Asynchronous Operations
Asynchronous operations allow a program to perform tasks without blocking the execution of other tasks. In the context of Redis and Node.js, asynchronous operations are crucial for maintaining performance and responsiveness, especially when dealing with I/O-bound operations like database access.

## Objectives
By the end of this guide, you should be able to:
1. Understand the importance of asynchronous operations in Redis.
2. Implement asynchronous operations using Redis in Node.js.
3. Apply these concepts in real-world applications.

## Understanding Asynchronous Operations

### What Are Asynchronous Operations?
Asynchronous operations enable tasks to start, run, and complete at different times. Unlike synchronous operations, which execute one after another and block further code execution until a task completes, asynchronous operations allow multiple tasks to proceed concurrently, improving efficiency.

### Asynchronous Programming in Node.js
Node.js uses an event-driven, non-blocking I/O model, making it ideal for handling asynchronous operations. This means that while a task (like a Redis command) is being processed, Node.js can continue executing other tasks.

## Implementing Asynchronous Operations with Redis

### Using Callbacks
In Node.js, callbacks are a common way to handle asynchronous operations. When interacting with Redis, most methods accept a callback function that executes once the operation is complete.

#### **Example: Using Callbacks**
```javascript
const redis = require('redis');
const client = redis.createClient();

client.set('name', 'Alice', (err, reply) => {
  if (err) throw err;
  console.log(reply); // Output: OK
});

client.get('name', (err, reply) => {
  if (err) throw err;
  console.log(reply); // Output: Alice
});
```

In this example, the `set` and `get` methods are non-blocking. The code inside the callback executes once the operation is complete.

### Using Promises
Promises provide a cleaner and more readable way to handle asynchronous operations compared to callbacks. They represent a value that may be available now, or in the future, or never.

#### **Example: Using Promises with `redis` Package**
The `redis` package does not natively support promises, but you can use the `util` module from Node.js to convert callback-based methods into promise-based ones.
```javascript
const { promisify } = require('util');
const redis = require('redis');
const client = redis.createClient();

const getAsync = promisify(client.get).bind(client);

client.set('name', 'Alice');

getAsync('name').then(reply => {
  console.log(reply); // Output: Alice
}).catch(err => {
  console.error(err);
});
```

### Using Async/Await
Async/await syntax is built on promises and provides a way to write asynchronous code that looks synchronous. It makes code more readable and easier to manage.

#### **Example: Using Async/Await**
```javascript
const { promisify } = require('util');
const redis = require('redis');
const client = redis.createClient();

const getAsync = promisify(client.get).bind(client);

async function getName() {
  try {
    await client.set('name', 'Alice');
    const reply = await getAsync('name');
    console.log(reply); // Output: Alice
  } catch (err) {
    console.error(err);
  }
}

getName();
```

## Real-World Application
Asynchronous operations are essential in real-world applications where multiple tasks need to be handled concurrently. For example:
- **Web Servers**: Handle multiple client requests simultaneously.
- **Background Tasks**: Perform tasks like sending emails or processing data without blocking the main application flow.
- **Caching**: Efficiently manage cache operations in applications, ensuring data is fetched quickly without blocking other processes.

4. How can you convert a callback-based Redis method into a promise-based one?
   a) By using the `async` keyword  
   b) By using the `util.promisify` function  
   c) By using the `promise` keyword  
   d) By using `then` and `catch`

# Using Kue as a Queue System

## Introduction to Queue Systems
Queue systems are essential in software development for managing tasks that need to be processed asynchronously. They allow you to handle background jobs, reduce latency in user interactions, and manage the distribution of tasks across multiple workers. Kue is a popular Node.js library that provides a simple way to manage job queues backed by Redis.

## Objectives
By the end of this guide, you should be able to:
1. Understand what Kue is and its role in a queue system.
2. Set up and use Kue to manage jobs.
3. Apply Kue in real-world applications.

## What is Kue?
Kue is a priority job queue backed by Redis that allows you to create background jobs and process them with workers. It supports job scheduling, retries, and job failure handling, making it suitable for a variety of tasks such as sending emails, processing files, and more.

## Setting Up Kue

### Installing Kue
To use Kue, you need to install it along with Redis. Ensure Redis is installed and running on your machine. You can install Kue via npm:

```bash
npm install kue
```

### Basic Usage

#### **Creating a Queue**
First, you need to create a queue that will hold your jobs. You do this by requiring Kue and initializing a queue instance.

```javascript
const kue = require('kue');
const queue = kue.createQueue();
```

#### **Creating a Job**
To add a job to the queue, use the `create` method. Each job should have a type and data associated with it.

```javascript
const job = queue.create('email', {
  title: 'Welcome Email for New User',
  to: 'user@example.com',
  body: 'Thank you for signing up!'
}).save((err) => {
  if (!err) console.log(`Job saved with ID: ${job.id}`);
});
```

In this example, an email job is created with details about the recipient and the email content.

### Processing Jobs
Workers are responsible for processing jobs in the queue. You define workers by specifying the job type they should handle and the function to execute.

```javascript
queue.process('email', (job, done) => {
  sendEmail(job.data.to, job.data.body, (err) => {
    if (err) return done(err);
    done();
  });
});

function sendEmail(to, body, callback) {
  // Simulate email sending
  console.log(`Sending email to ${to}: ${body}`);
  callback(null); // Call callback with no error on success
}
```

In this example, the worker listens for jobs of type `email` and processes them using the `sendEmail` function.

### Monitoring and Error Handling

#### **Job Events**
Kue provides various events to monitor the status of jobs, such as `complete`, `failed`, and `progress`.

```javascript
job.on('complete', () => {
  console.log('Job completed');
}).on('failed', (err) => {
  console.log('Job failed', err);
}).on('progress', (progress) => {
  console.log(`Job progress: ${progress}%`);
});
```

#### **Error Handling**
Always handle potential errors during job processing to avoid crashes. Use the `done` function to signal job completion or failure.

## Real-World Application
Kue is used in many real-world applications to handle background processes, such as:
- **Email Notifications**: Sending emails without blocking the main application.
- **Data Processing**: Handling large data sets or files asynchronously.
- **Task Scheduling**: Scheduling tasks to be performed at specific times.

For example, an e-commerce website can use Kue to send order confirmation emails to customers, update inventory levels, and generate invoices, all without delaying the user's experience.

# Building a Basic Express App Interacting with a Redis Server

## Introduction to Express and Redis
Express is a fast, minimalist web framework for Node.js that simplifies the process of building web applications. Redis is an in-memory data structure store used as a database, cache, and message broker. Combining Express and Redis allows you to build efficient and scalable web applications that can quickly store and retrieve data.

## Objectives
By the end of this guide, you should be able to:
1. Set up a basic Express app.
2. Connect the Express app to a Redis server.
3. Perform basic CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations using Redis.
4. Apply these concepts in real-world applications.

## Setting Up the Project

### Installing Dependencies
First, ensure you have Node.js and Redis installed on your machine. Then, create a new project directory and install the necessary packages:

```bash
mkdir express-redis-app
cd express-redis-app
npm init -y
npm install express redis
```

This will create a basic Node.js project and install Express and Redis libraries.

### Creating the Express Server

1. **Create a File Named `server.js`:**

   ```javascript
   const express = require('express');
   const redis = require('redis');

   const app = express();
   const port = 3000;

   // Middleware to parse JSON
   app.use(express.json());

   // Create a Redis client
   const client = redis.createClient();

   client.on('error', (err) => {
     console.log('Error ' + err);
   });

   // Home route
   app.get('/', (req, res) => {
     res.send('Welcome to the Express Redis app');
   });

   app.listen(port, () => {
     console.log(`Server running at http://localhost:${port}`);
   });
   ```

2. **Running the Server:**
   Run the server using the command:

   ```bash
   node server.js
   ```

   This starts an Express server listening on port 3000. You can visit `http://localhost:3000` to see the welcome message.

## Connecting to Redis

### Creating a Redis Client
In the above setup, we already created a Redis client using `redis.createClient()`. This client allows us to interact with the Redis server.

### Basic CRUD Operations

1. **Create (Set a Value):**

   To set a value in Redis, use the `set` method.

   ```javascript
   app.post('/set', (req, res) => {
     const { key, value } = req.body;
     client.set(key, value, (err, reply) => {
       if (err) res.status(500).send(err);
       res.send(`Key ${key} set with value ${value}`);
     });
   });
   ```

   Example request using `curl`:
   ```bash
   curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"key":"name", "value":"Alice"}' http://localhost:3000/set
   ```

2. **Read (Get a Value):**

   To retrieve a value, use the `get` method.

   ```javascript
   app.get('/get/:key', (req, res) => {
     const key = req.params.key;
     client.get(key, (err, reply) => {
       if (err) res.status(500).send(err);
       res.send(reply);
     });
   });
   ```

   Example request:
   ```bash
   curl http://localhost:3000/get/name
   ```

3. **Update (Set a New Value):**

   Redis does not distinguish between creating and updating keys; setting a new value for an existing key is the same as creating it.

   ```javascript
   app.put('/update', (req, res) => {
     const { key, value } = req.body;
     client.set(key, value, (err, reply) => {
       if (err) res.status(500).send(err);
       res.send(`Key ${key} updated with value ${value}`);
     });
   });
   ```

   Example request:
   ```bash
   curl -X PUT -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"key":"name", "value":"Bob"}' http://localhost:3000/update
   ```

4. **Delete:**

   To delete a key, use the `del` method.

   ```javascript
   app.delete('/delete/:key', (req, res) => {
     const key = req.params.key;
     client.del(key, (err, reply) => {
       if (err) res.status(500).send(err);
       res.send(`Key ${key} deleted`);
     });
   });
   ```

   Example request:
   ```bash
   curl -X DELETE http://localhost:3000/delete/name
   ```

## Real-World Application
A basic Express and Redis setup can be extended to create more complex systems like:
- **Session Management:** Store user sessions in Redis for faster access.
- **Caching:** Cache frequently accessed data to improve application performance.
- **Task Queuing:** Use Redis as a message broker to queue background tasks.

For example, an e-commerce site can use Redis to cache product information, manage user sessions, and queue tasks like order processing or email notifications.

# Building a Basic Express App with Redis and Queue Integration

## Introduction
This guide will walk you through building a basic Express app that interacts with a Redis server and utilizes a queue system. The combination of Express, Redis, and a queue system like Kue allows you to create efficient and scalable web applications. Redis will be used for both caching data and managing a job queue.

## Objectives
By the end of this guide, you should be able to:
1. Set up a basic Express app.
2. Connect the Express app to a Redis server.
3. Implement a queue system using Redis.
4. Perform basic CRUD operations with Redis and queue tasks.
5. Understand real-world applications of these technologies.

## Setting Up the Project

### Installing Dependencies
Ensure you have Node.js and Redis installed. Then, create a project directory and install the necessary packages:

```bash
mkdir express-redis-queue-app
cd express-redis-queue-app
npm init -y
npm install express redis kue
```

### Creating the Express Server

1. **Create a File Named `server.js`:**

   ```javascript
   const express = require('express');
   const redis = require('redis');
   const kue = require('kue');

   const app = express();
   const port = 3000;

   // Middleware to parse JSON
   app.use(express.json());

   // Create a Redis client
   const client = redis.createClient();
   client.on('error', (err) => {
     console.log('Error ' + err);
   });

   // Create a Kue queue
   const queue = kue.createQueue();

   // Home route
   app.get('/', (req, res) => {
     res.send('Welcome to the Express Redis Queue app');
   });

   app.listen(port, () => {
     console.log(`Server running at http://localhost:${port}`);
   });
   ```

2. **Running the Server:**
   Start the server using:

   ```bash
   node server.js
   ```

   The server listens on port 3000. You can access it at `http://localhost:3000`.

## Interacting with Redis

### Basic CRUD Operations

1. **Create (Set a Value):**

   ```javascript
   app.post('/set', (req, res) => {
     const { key, value } = req.body;
     client.set(key, value, (err, reply) => {
       if (err) return res.status(500).send(err);
       res.send(`Key ${key} set with value ${value}`);
     });
   });
   ```

   Example request:
   ```bash
   curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"key":"name", "value":"Alice"}' http://localhost:3000/set
   ```

2. **Read (Get a Value):**

   ```javascript
   app.get('/get/:key', (req, res) => {
     const key = req.params.key;
     client.get(key, (err, reply) => {
       if (err) return res.status(500).send(err);
       res.send(reply);
     });
   });
   ```

   Example request:
   ```bash
   curl http://localhost:3000/get/name
   ```

3. **Update (Set a New Value):**
   The update operation is the same as setting a value.

   ```javascript
   app.put('/update', (req, res) => {
     const { key, value } = req.body;
     client.set(key, value, (err, reply) => {
       if (err) return res.status(500).send(err);
       res.send(`Key ${key} updated with value ${value}`);
     });
   });
   ```

   Example request:
   ```bash
   curl -X PUT -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"key":"name", "value":"Bob"}' http://localhost:3000/update
   ```

4. **Delete:**

   ```javascript
   app.delete('/delete/:key', (req, res) => {
     const key = req.params.key;
     client.del(key, (err, reply) => {
       if (err) return res.status(500).send(err);
       res.send(`Key ${key} deleted`);
     });
   });
   ```

   Example request:
   ```bash
   curl -X DELETE http://localhost:3000/delete/name
   ```

## Using Kue for Queuing

### Creating a Queue and Jobs

1. **Creating a Job:**
   ```javascript
   app.post('/job', (req, res) => {
     const { title, email, body } = req.body;
     const job = queue.create('email', {
       title: title,
       to: email,
       body: body
     }).save((err) => {
       if (err) return res.status(500).send(err);
       res.send(`Job created with ID: ${job.id}`);
     });
   });
   ```

   Example request:
   ```bash
   curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"title":"Welcome","email":"user@example.com","body":"Welcome to our service!"}' http://localhost:3000/job
   ```

2. **Processing Jobs:**

   Define a worker to process jobs of type `email`:

   ```javascript
   queue.process('email', (job, done) => {
     sendEmail(job.data.to, job.data.body, done);
   });

   function sendEmail(to, body, done) {
     console.log(`Sending email to ${to}: ${body}`);
     done(); // Simulate success
   }
   ```

   This worker listens for new email jobs and processes them by calling the `sendEmail` function.

### Monitoring and Handling Job Events

Kue provides event listeners to monitor the status of jobs. You can use these events to track job progress, completion, and failure.

```javascript
queue.on('job complete', (id, result) => {
  console.log(`Job ${id} completed`);
});

queue.on('job failed', (id, errorMessage) => {
  console.log(`Job ${id} failed with error: ${errorMessage}`);
});
```

## Real-World Applications
This setup can be applied in various real-world scenarios, such as:
- **Sending Notification Emails:** Queue and process emails for user sign-ups, password resets, and notifications.
- **Task Scheduling:** Schedule tasks like generating reports or updating databases without blocking the main application.
- **Data Processing:** Queue and handle large data processing tasks asynchronously.

For instance, an online store can use this setup to send order confirmation emails and update inventory asynchronously, ensuring a smooth user experience without delays.
