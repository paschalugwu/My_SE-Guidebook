2. **DNS Query Sent by DNS Client:**
   - The DNS client sends a query to a DNS server, asking for the IP address associated with the entered domain name.

3. **Root DNS Server:**
   - If the local DNS server doesn't have the information, it queries a root DNS server. The root DNS server provides the DNS server responsible for top-level domains (TLDs).

4. **TLD DNS Server:**
   - The local DNS server then queries the TLD DNS server (e.g., .com) to get information about the authoritative DNS server for the specific domain.

5. **Authoritative DNS Server:**
   - The TLD DNS server directs the local DNS server to the authoritative DNS server for the domain (e.g., ns1.example.com).

6. **IP Address Retrieval:**
   - The authoritative DNS server provides the IP address associated with the domain name back to the local DNS server.

7. **IP Address Sent to DNS Client:**
   - Finally, the local DNS server sends the IP address to the DNS client, allowing the user's device to establish a connection with the desired website.

### 4.5 Practical Application in Real-World Projects:

#### 4.5.1 Project Scenario:

- **Scenario:** Launching a website for a school project.

- **Application:** Register a domain name (e.g., www.schoolproject.com) and set up DNS records to point to the hosting provider's IP address. Users can then access the website by typing the domain name instead of the numerical IP address.

2. **Incoming Data (Destination NAT - DNAT):**
   - When the external server responds, the NAT router replaces the destination IP address (public) with the internal IP address of the original requesting device.

### 5.5 Practical Application in Real-World Projects:

#### 5.5.1 Project Scenario:

- **Scenario:** Setting up a home network with multiple devices sharing a single internet connection.

- **Application:** Use NAT in the home router to allow devices like computers, smartphones, and smart TVs to access the internet using a single public IP address provided by the Internet Service Provider (ISP).
