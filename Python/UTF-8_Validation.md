# Bitwise Operations in Python

Bitwise operations involve directly manipulating the individual bits of binary numbers. They are essential for tasks that require performance optimization, low-level data processing, or working with systems where hardware or protocol specifications involve bit manipulation.

## 1. **Bitwise AND (`&`)**

The `&` operator compares each bit of two numbers and returns a new number whose bits are set to `1` only where both corresponding bits are `1`.

### Example
```python
a = 12    # In binary: 1100
b = 10    # In binary: 1010
result = a & b  # Result in binary: 1000 (decimal: 8)

print(result)  # Output: 8
```

### Real-World Application
Bitwise AND can be used to mask bits. For example, extracting the last digit of a number in its binary form:
```python
number = 29      # Binary: 11101
mask = 0b111     # Binary: 00011
last_digits = number & mask  # Extracts the last 3 bits

print(last_digits)  # Output: 5 (Binary: 101)
```

## 2. **Bitwise OR (`|`)**

The `|` operator compares each bit of two numbers and returns a new number whose bits are set to `1` if either of the corresponding bits is `1`.

### Example
```python
a = 12    # In binary: 1100
b = 10    # In binary: 1010
result = a | b  # Result in binary: 1110 (decimal: 14)

print(result)  # Output: 14
```

### Real-World Application
Bitwise OR is useful in setting specific bits to `1`. For instance, to set a particular flag in a configuration byte:
```python
config = 0b1010     # Original config: 1010
flag = 0b0100       # Flag to set:     0100
new_config = config | flag

print(bin(new_config))  # Output: 0b1110
```

## 3. **Bitwise XOR (`^`)**

The `^` operator compares each bit of two numbers and returns a new number whose bits are set to `1` only if one of the corresponding bits is `1`, but not both.

### Example
```python
a = 12    # In binary: 1100
b = 10    # In binary: 1010
result = a ^ b  # Result in binary: 0110 (decimal: 6)

print(result)  # Output: 6
```

### Real-World Application
Bitwise XOR is often used to toggle bits or to swap two variables without a temporary variable:
```python
x = 5
y = 9

x = x ^ y
y = x ^ y
x = x ^ y

print(x, y)  # Output: 9 5
```

## 4. **Bitwise NOT (`~`)**

The `~` operator inverts all the bits of a number, changing `1` to `0` and `0` to `1`. It effectively computes `-n - 1`.

### Example
```python
a = 5     # In binary: 00000101
result = ~a  # Result in binary: 11111010 (decimal: -6)

print(result)  # Output: -6
```

### Real-World Application
Bitwise NOT can be used in applications requiring the inversion of bit patterns, such as switching control signals or bitwise operations in cryptographic algorithms.

## 5. **Bitwise Shift Left (`<<`)**

The `<<` operator shifts the bits of a number to the left by a specified number of positions. Each shift left multiplies the number by 2.

### Example
```python
a = 5     # In binary: 00000101
result = a << 2  # Shift left by 2, binary: 00010100 (decimal: 20)

print(result)  # Output: 20
```

### Real-World Application
Left shifts are used in operations such as multiplying by powers of two or encoding data in communication protocols.

## 6. **Bitwise Shift Right (`>>`)**

The `>>` operator shifts the bits of a number to the right by a specified number of positions. Each shift right divides the number by 2.

### Example
```python
a = 20    # In binary: 00010100
result = a >> 2  # Shift right by 2, binary: 00000101 (decimal: 5)

print(result)  # Output: 5
```

### Real-World Application
Right shifts are used in operations such as integer division by powers of two or decoding data in communication protocols.

## **Putting It All Together**

Let's use these operations to solve a practical problem: Checking if a number is a power of two.

A number is a power of two if it has exactly one bit set. You can use a combination of AND and NOT to verify this:
```python
def is_power_of_two(n):
    return n > 0 and (n & (n - 1)) == 0

# Test the function
print(is_power_of_two(16))  # Output: True
print(is_power_of_two(18))  # Output: False
```

# UTF-8 Encoding Scheme

UTF-8 (Unicode Transformation Format - 8-bit) is a variable-length character encoding used for electronic communication. It can encode all possible characters (code points) in Unicode using one to four bytes. This encoding is backward-compatible with ASCII, which means that any valid ASCII text is also valid UTF-8 encoded text.

## **Encoding Rules**

### Single Byte (ASCII)
- For characters in the range U+0000 to U+007F (basic ASCII), UTF-8 uses a single byte.
- The first bit is `0`, followed by 7 bits of the Unicode code point.

### Example
```plaintext
Character: A
Unicode: U+0041
Binary: 01000001
UTF-8: 01000001 (0x41)
```

### Two Bytes
- For characters in the range U+0080 to U+07FF, UTF-8 uses two bytes.
- The first byte starts with `110`, followed by 5 bits of the Unicode code point.
- The second byte starts with `10`, followed by 6 bits of the Unicode code point.

### Example
```plaintext
Character: √á
Unicode: U+00C7
Binary: 11000011111
UTF-8: 11000011 10000111 (0xC3 0x87)
```

### Three Bytes
- For characters in the range U+0800 to U+FFFF, UTF-8 uses three bytes.
- The first byte starts with `1110`, followed by 4 bits of the Unicode code point.
- The second and third bytes start with `10`, followed by 6 bits each of the Unicode code point.

### Example
```plaintext
Character: ‡§ó
Unicode: U+0917
Binary: 1001000111
UTF-8: 11100000 10100100 10010111 (0xE0 0xA4 0x97)
```

### Four Bytes
- For characters in the range U+10000 to U+10FFFF, UTF-8 uses four bytes.
- The first byte starts with `11110`, followed by 3 bits of the Unicode code point.
- The second, third, and fourth bytes start with `10`, followed by 6 bits each of the Unicode code point.

### Example
```plaintext
Character: êçà
Unicode: U+10348
Binary: 10000001101000
UTF-8: 11110000 10010000 10001101 10001000 (0xF0 0x90 0x8D 0x88)
```

## **Patterns Representing a Valid UTF-8 Encoded Character**

1. **1-byte character**: `0xxxxxxx`
2. **2-byte character**: `110xxxxx 10xxxxxx`
3. **3-byte character**: `1110xxxx 10xxxxxx 10xxxxxx`
4. **4-byte character**: `11110xxx 10xxxxxx 10xxxxxx 10xxxxxx`

Each `x` represents a bit of the actual code point being encoded.

### **Real-World Application**
UTF-8 is the dominant character encoding for the web and is used in various file formats and protocols.

#### Example in Python:
Encoding a string in UTF-8:
```python
text = "Hello, ‰∏ñÁïå"  # "Hello, World" in Chinese
encoded_text = text.encode('utf-8')

print(encoded_text)  # Output: b'Hello, \xe4\xb8\x96\xe7\x95\x8c'
```

Decoding a UTF-8 byte sequence:
```python
encoded_text = b'Hello, \xe4\xb8\x96\xe7\x95\x8c'
decoded_text = encoded_text.decode('utf-8')

print(decoded_text)  # Output: Hello, ‰∏ñÁïå

# Data Representation: Working with Data at the Byte Level

Understanding how data is represented and manipulated at the byte level is crucial for various applications such as system programming, data processing, and networking. This note covers fundamental concepts and operations for representing and working with data at the byte level in Python.

## **Basics of Data Representation**

### **Bits and Bytes**

- **Bit**: The smallest unit of data, representing a `0` or `1`.
- **Byte**: A group of 8 bits. Commonly used as the smallest addressable unit of memory.

### **Binary, Hexadecimal, and Decimal Systems**

- **Binary (Base-2)**: Uses `0` and `1` to represent values.
  - Example: `1101` in binary equals `13` in decimal.
- **Decimal (Base-10)**: The standard system using digits `0-9`.
  - Example: `13` in decimal equals `13` in decimal.
- **Hexadecimal (Base-16)**: Uses `0-9` and `A-F` to represent values.
  - Example: `D` in hexadecimal equals `13` in decimal.

### Example
```python
binary = '1101'          # Binary representation
decimal = int(binary, 2) # Convert to decimal
hexadecimal = hex(decimal)  # Convert to hexadecimal

print(decimal)      # Output: 13
print(hexadecimal)  # Output: 0xd
```

## **Byte-Level Operations**

### **Creating and Accessing Bytes**

Bytes are immutable sequences of bytes (8-bit values). They are commonly used to handle binary data.

#### Example
```python
# Creating a bytes object
data = b'\x48\x65\x6c\x6c\x6f'  # Represents "Hello"

# Accessing individual bytes
print(data[0])  # Output: 72 (ASCII for 'H')
print(data[1])  # Output: 101 (ASCII for 'e')
```

### **Converting Between Strings and Bytes**

- **Encoding**: Convert a string to bytes.
- **Decoding**: Convert bytes to a string.

#### Example
```python
# Convert string to bytes
text = "Hello"
encoded = text.encode('utf-8')

# Convert bytes to string
decoded = encoded.decode('utf-8')

print(encoded)  # Output: b'Hello'
print(decoded)  # Output: Hello
```

### **Manipulating Byte Data**

You can perform bitwise operations on byte data, similar to integers.

#### Example
```python
# Perform bitwise AND on bytes
byte1 = b'\x0F'  # 00001111 in binary
byte2 = b'\xF0'  # 11110000 in binary

result = bytes([byte1[0] & byte2[0]])
print(result)  # Output: b'\x00'
```

### **Struct Module**

The `struct` module in Python provides functionality for working with packed binary data.

#### Example
```python
import struct

# Pack an integer into bytes
packed_data = struct.pack('>I', 1024)  # '>I' means big-endian unsigned int
print(packed_data)  # Output: b'\x00\x00\x04\x00'

# Unpack bytes into an integer
unpacked_data = struct.unpack('>I', packed_data)
print(unpacked_data[0])  # Output: 1024
```

## **Real-World Applications**

### **Network Protocols**

In network protocols, data is often represented at the byte level for efficient transmission. Understanding byte-level representation is essential for designing and debugging network communication.

#### Example
```python
# Create a message in bytes
message = b'\x01\x02\x03\x04'  # Example binary message

# Simulate sending and receiving a message
received_message = message

# Decode the received message
print(received_message)  # Output: b'\x01\x02\x03\x04'
```

### **File I/O Operations**

Reading and writing binary files such as images or executable files require working with bytes directly.

#### Example
```python
# Write bytes to a binary file
with open('example.bin', 'wb') as f:
    f.write(b'\x00\xFF\x10')

# Read bytes from a binary file
with open('example.bin', 'rb') as f:
    data = f.read()

print(data)  # Output: b'\x00\xff\x10'
```

# Iterating Through Lists, Accessing List Elements, and Understanding List Comprehensions

## **Python Lists**

### **Introduction to Lists**

A list in Python is an ordered collection of items that can store elements of various data types. Lists are mutable, meaning you can modify them after their creation.

#### Example
```python
# Creating a list
fruits = ['apple', 'banana', 'cherry']
print(fruits)  # Output: ['apple', 'banana', 'cherry']
```

### **Accessing List Elements**

You can access elements in a list using indexing. Python supports both positive and negative indexing.

#### Example
```python
# Accessing elements
print(fruits[0])  # Output: apple
print(fruits[-1]) # Output: cherry
```

### **Iterating Through Lists**

You can iterate through a list using a `for` loop, which allows you to perform operations on each element.

#### Example
```python
# Iterating through a list
for fruit in fruits:
    print(fruit)
```

### **List Comprehensions**

List comprehensions provide a concise way to create lists. They consist of brackets containing an expression followed by a `for` clause.

#### Syntax
```python
new_list = [expression for item in iterable if condition]
```

#### Example
```python
# Creating a list of squares
squares = [x**2 for x in range(5)]
print(squares)  # Output: [0, 1, 4, 9, 16]
```

## **Real-World Applications**

### **Filtering and Transforming Data**

List comprehensions are particularly useful for filtering and transforming data in lists.

#### Example
```python
# Filtering even numbers
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]
evens = [num for num in numbers if num % 2 == 0]
print(evens)  # Output: [2, 4, 6]
```

### **Reading and Processing File Data**

You can read data from a file and process it into a list for further analysis.

#### Example
```python
# Reading lines from a file and stripping newline characters
with open('data.txt') as f:
    lines = [line.strip() for line in f]
print(lines)
```

### **Combining Lists**

Combining and manipulating lists is common in data aggregation and analysis tasks.

#### Example
```python
# Combining two lists using list comprehension
list1 = [1, 2, 3]
list2 = [4, 5, 6]
combined = [x + y for x, y in zip(list1, list2)]
print(combined)  # Output: [5, 7, 9]

# Boolean Logic: Applying Logical Operations to Make Decisions

Boolean logic is fundamental in programming for making decisions based on conditions. This note covers the basics of Boolean logic, including logical operators, and demonstrates how these can be applied in real-world scenarios with Python.

## **Understanding Boolean Values**

### **Boolean Type**

In Python, a Boolean is a data type that can have one of two values: `True` or `False`. These are used to represent the truth value of expressions and conditions.

#### Example
```python
is_raining = True
is_sunny = False

print(is_raining)  # Output: True
print(is_sunny)    # Output: False
```

## **Logical Operators**

Python provides several logical operators to combine or modify Boolean expressions:

1. **AND (`and`)**
2. **OR (`or`)**
3. **NOT (`not`)**

### **AND Operator**

The `and` operator returns `True` only if both operands are `True`.

#### Example
```python
# Using the AND operator
is_raining = True
is_windy = False

print(is_raining and is_windy)  # Output: False
```

### **OR Operator**

The `or` operator returns `True` if at least one operand is `True`.

#### Example
```python
# Using the OR operator
is_raining = True
is_sunny = False

print(is_raining or is_sunny)  # Output: True
```

### **NOT Operator**

The `not` operator returns `True` if the operand is `False`, and `False` if the operand is `True`.

#### Example
```python
# Using the NOT operator
is_raining = True

print(not is_raining)  # Output: False
```

## **Combining Logical Operators**

Logical operators can be combined to form more complex conditions.

#### Example
```python
# Combining AND, OR, and NOT operators
is_raining = True
is_sunny = False
is_windy = True

print((is_raining or is_sunny) and not is_windy)  # Output: False
```

## **Conditional Statements**

Conditional statements use Boolean logic to control the flow of a program.

### **If Statements**

An `if` statement executes a block of code if a condition is `True`.

#### Example
```python
# Using an if statement
is_raining = True

if is_raining:
    print("Take an umbrella.")
```

### **If-Else Statements**

An `if-else` statement executes one block of code if a condition is `True` and another block if the condition is `False`.

#### Example
```python
# Using if-else statement
is_sunny = False

if is_sunny:
    print("Wear sunglasses.")
else:
    print("You don't need sunglasses.")
```

### **Elif Statements**

An `elif` statement is used to check multiple conditions.

#### Example
```python
# Using elif statement
temperature = 25

if temperature > 30:
    print("It's hot.")
elif temperature > 20:
    print("It's warm.")
else:
    print("It's cold.")
```

## **Real-World Applications**

### **Form Validation**

Boolean logic is used in form validation to ensure that user input meets certain criteria.

#### Example
```python
# Form validation
username = "user123"
password = "pass123"

if len(username) > 5 and len(password) > 5:
    print("Form is valid.")
else:
    print("Form is invalid.")
```

### **Game Logic**

Boolean logic is often used in games to determine outcomes based on player actions.

#### Example
```python
# Game logic
has_key = True
door_locked = False

if has_key and not door_locked:
    print("You can open the door.")
else:
    print("You cannot open the door.")
```

### **Access Control**

Boolean logic is used to check if users have the necessary permissions to access certain features.

#### Example
```python
# Access control
is_admin = True
has_permission = False

if is_admin or has_permission:
    print("Access granted.")
else:
    print("Access denied.")
```
