## Prime Numbers

### Understanding Prime Numbers

Prime numbers are natural numbers greater than 1 that have no divisors other than 1 and themselves. This means a prime number $\( p \)$ can only be evenly divided by 1 and $\( p \)$.

**Examples:**
- 2 (divisors: 1, 2)
- 3 (divisors: 1, 3)
- 5 (divisors: 1, 5)
- 7 (divisors: 1, 7)

### Non-Prime (Composite) Numbers

Numbers greater than 1 that are not prime are called composite numbers. They have divisors other than 1 and themselves.

**Examples:**
- 4 (divisors: 1, 2, 4)
- 6 (divisors: 1, 2, 3, 6)
- 8 (divisors: 1, 2, 4, 8)
- 9 (divisors: 1, 3, 9)

### Efficient Algorithms for Identifying Prime Numbers

To find prime numbers efficiently, we can use various algorithms. Here are two commonly used methods:

#### 1. Trial Division

Trial division tests if a number $\( n \)$ is prime by dividing it by all numbers less than $\( n \)$. If $\( n \)$ is divisible by any of these numbers, it's not prime.

**Steps:**
1. Start with a number $\( n \)$.
2. Check divisibility from 2 to $\( \sqrt{n} \)$.
3. If $\( n \)$ is divisible by any of these numbers, it's not prime.

**Example in Python:**
```python
def is_prime(n):
    if n <= 1:
        return False
    for i in range(2, int(n**0.5) + 1):
        if n % i == 0:
            return False
    return True

# Testing the function
print(is_prime(11))  # True
print(is_prime(15))  # False
```

#### 2. Sieve of Eratosthenes

The Sieve of Eratosthenes is an efficient algorithm for finding all prime numbers up to a specified integer $\( n \)$.

**Steps:**
1. Create a list of integers from 2 to $\( n \)$.
2. Start with the first prime number (2).
3. Mark all multiples of this prime number as non-prime.
4. Move to the next number and repeat step 3 until you have processed numbers up to $\( \sqrt{n} \)$.

**Example in Python:**
```python
def sieve_of_eratosthenes(n):
    primes = [True] * (n + 1)
    p = 2
    while (p**2 <= n):
        if primes[p]:
            for i in range(p**2, n + 1, p):
                primes[i] = False
        p += 1
    prime_numbers = [p for p in range(2, n + 1) if primes[p]]
    return prime_numbers

# Testing the function
print(sieve_of_eratosthenes(30))  # [2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29]
```

## Sieve of Eratosthenes

### Understanding the Sieve of Eratosthenes

The Sieve of Eratosthenes is an ancient algorithm for finding all prime numbers up to a specified integer $\( n \)$. It is highly efficient and works by iteratively marking the multiples of each prime number starting from 2.

### How the Algorithm Works

1. **Initialization:**
   - Create a list of boolean values, `primes`, indexed from 0 to $\( n \)$, initially all set to `True`. A value in `primes[i]` will be `True` if $\( i \)$ is a prime number.
   - Set `primes[0]` and `primes[1]` to `False` because 0 and 1 are not prime numbers.

2. **Marking Multiples:**
   - Start with the first prime number, $\( p = 2 \)$.
   - Mark all multiples of $\( p \)$ (i.e., $\( 2p, 3p, 4p, \ldots \)$) as `False` since they are not prime.
   - Find the next number in the list that is `True` and repeat the process.
   - Continue this process until $\( p^2 \)$ is greater than $\( n \)$.

3. **Collecting Primes:**
   - The numbers which remain `True` in the `primes` list are the prime numbers up to $\( n \)$.

### Example in Python
Here is a Python implementation of the Sieve of Eratosthenes:

```python
def sieve_of_eratosthenes(n):
    primes = [True] * (n + 1)
    p = 2
    while (p * p <= n):
        if primes[p]:
            for i in range(p * p, n + 1, p):
                primes[i] = False
        p += 1
    prime_numbers = [p for p in range(2, n + 1) if primes[p]]
    return prime_numbers

# Testing the function
print(sieve_of_eratosthenes(30))  # Output: [2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29]
```

## Game Theory

### Basic Principles of Competitive Games

Game theory studies strategic interactions where players make decisions to maximize their outcomes. In competitive games, players often take turns, and each player's decision can affect the outcomes for all players.

**Key Concepts:**
1. **Players:** Individuals or entities making decisions in the game.
2. **Strategies:** Plans or actions taken by players to achieve their objectives.
3. **Payoffs:** Outcomes or rewards received by players based on the combination of strategies chosen.
4. **Games:** Scenarios or environments in which players interact.

### Optimal Play

Optimal play involves making the best possible moves to maximize a player's advantage or minimize losses, considering the strategies of other players. It often leads to a situation where no player can improve their outcome by changing their strategy unilaterally (Nash Equilibrium).

**Examples:**
- In chess, optimal play involves making moves that maximize the player's chances of winning or drawing while minimizing the opponent's chances of winning.
- In tic-tac-toe, optimal play ensures that a player either wins or ties the game.

### Understanding Win Conditions and Strategies

**Win Conditions:** 
These are specific conditions or states of the game that result in a player winning.

**Strategies Leading to a Win:**
Strategies that increase the likelihood of meeting the win conditions. This can involve offensive tactics (aggressively pursuing win conditions) or defensive tactics (preventing the opponent from achieving their win conditions).

### Example: Tic-Tac-Toe

**Win Conditions:**
- A player wins by placing three of their marks in a row, column, or diagonal.

**Strategies:**
- **Offensive Strategy:** Focus on creating opportunities to place three marks in a row.
- **Defensive Strategy:** Block the opponent's attempts to place three marks in a row.

**Optimal Play:**
- Always take the center if available.
- If the center is taken, take a corner.
- Block the opponent from completing three in a row.

### Example in Python: Tic-Tac-Toe

```python
# Tic-Tac-Toe game implementation
def print_board(board):
    for row in board:
        print(" | ".join(row))
        print("-" * 5)

def check_win(board, mark):
    # Check rows, columns, and diagonals
    win_cond = [
        [board[0][0], board[0][1], board[0][2]],
        [board[1][0], board[1][1], board[1][2]],
        [board[2][0], board[2][1], board[2][2]],
        [board[0][0], board[1][0], board[2][0]],
        [board[0][1], board[1][1], board[2][1]],
        [board[0][2], board[1][2], board[2][2]],
        [board[0][0], board[1][1], board[2][2]],
        [board[2][0], board[1][1], board[0][2]],
    ]
    return [mark, mark, mark] in win_cond

def tic_tac_toe():
    board = [[" " for _ in range(3)] for _ in range(3)]
    players = ["X", "O"]
    turn = 0

    for _ in range(9):
        print_board(board)
        row = int(input(f"Player {players[turn]}, enter the row (0-2): "))
        col = int(input(f"Player {players[turn]}, enter the column (0-2): "))
        
        if board[row][col] == " ":
            board[row][col] = players[turn]
            if check_win(board, players[turn]):
                print_board(board)
                print(f"Player {players[turn]} wins!")
                return
            turn = (turn + 1) % 2
        else:
            print("Cell already taken, try again.")

    print_board(board)
    print("It's a draw!")

# Run the game
tic_tac_toe()
```

## Dynamic Programming and Memoization

### Introduction to Dynamic Programming

Dynamic programming is a method for solving complex problems by breaking them down into simpler subproblems. It is particularly useful when the problem can be divided into overlapping subproblems that can be solved independently.

**Key Concepts:**
1. **Overlapping Subproblems:** Problems that can be broken down into smaller, reusable subproblems.
2. **Optimal Substructure:** The optimal solution of the problem can be constructed from optimal solutions of its subproblems.

### Memoization

Memoization is an optimization technique used to speed up dynamic programming. It involves storing the results of expensive function calls and reusing those results when the same inputs occur again.

**Key Concepts:**
1. **Cache:** A storage structure (like a dictionary) that saves the results of subproblems.
2. **Recursive Solution:** A solution that breaks the problem into smaller parts and solves each part recursively, storing results in the cache.

### Example: Fibonacci Sequence

The Fibonacci sequence is a classic example where dynamic programming and memoization can be applied.

**Recursive Solution Without Memoization:**

```python
def fibonacci(n):
    if n <= 1:
        return n
    return fibonacci(n-1) + fibonacci(n-2)

# Testing the function
print(fibonacci(10))  # Output: 55
```

This approach is inefficient for large $\( n \)$ because it recalculates the same values multiple times.

**Optimized Solution With Memoization:**

```python
def fibonacci_memo(n, memo={}):
    if n in memo:
        return memo[n]
    if n <= 1:
        return n
    memo[n] = fibonacci_memo(n-1, memo) + fibonacci_memo(n-2, memo)
    return memo[n]

# Testing the function
print(fibonacci_memo(10))  # Output: 55
```

By using a memoization technique, we store previously computed values and avoid redundant calculations, making the algorithm more efficient.

### Application in the Ambrosial App

Consider a feature in the Ambrosial app where users can participate in recipe challenges that involve multiple rounds. Each round requires optimizing ingredient combinations to achieve the best recipe score.

**Steps to Implement:**

1. **User Interface:**
   - Add a form where users can input ingredients and their quantities.
   - Add a button to calculate the optimal combination for maximum recipe score.

2. **Backend Processing:**
   - Use dynamic programming and memoization to calculate the best ingredient combinations efficiently.

3. **Displaying Results:**
   - Show the optimal combination and the recipe score on the results page.

### Example: Recipe Score Optimization

```python
def max_recipe_score(ingredients, max_quantity, memo={}):
    if max_quantity in memo:
        return memo[max_quantity]
    if max_quantity == 0 or not ingredients:
        return 0
    
    ingredient = ingredients[0]
    include = (ingredient['score'] + max_recipe_score(ingredients, max_quantity - ingredient['quantity'], memo)
               if ingredient['quantity'] <= max_quantity else 0)
    exclude = max_recipe_score(ingredients[1:], max_quantity, memo)
    
    memo[max_quantity] = max(include, exclude)
    return memo[max_quantity]

# Example ingredients and their scores
ingredients = [
    {'name': 'flour', 'quantity': 2, 'score': 3},
    {'name': 'sugar', 'quantity': 1, 'score': 2},
    {'name': 'butter', 'quantity': 3, 'score': 4}
]

# Testing the function
max_quantity = 5
print(max_recipe_score(ingredients, max_quantity))  # Output: 6
```

#### Loops

Loops allow you to execute a block of code multiple times. Python provides two main types of loops: `for` loops and `while` loops.

**For Loops:**
A `for` loop iterates over a sequence (such as a list, tuple, or string) and executes a block of code for each item in the sequence.

```python
# Example: Iterating over a list
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
for number in numbers:
    print(number)
```

**While Loops:**
A `while` loop executes a block of code as long as a specified condition is `True`.

```python
# Example: Using a while loop
count = 0
while count < 5:
    print(count)
    count += 1
```

#### Conditional Statements

Conditional statements allow you to execute different blocks of code based on certain conditions. The main conditional statements in Python are `if`, `elif`, and `else`.

```python
# Example: Using conditional statements
number = 10
if number > 0:
    print("Positive number")
elif number == 0:
    print("Zero")
else:
    print("Negative number")
```

### Arrays and Lists

Arrays and lists are used to store collections of items. In Python, lists are more commonly used and provide flexibility and ease of use.

**Lists:**
A list is a collection of items that can be of different types. Lists are mutable, meaning their elements can be changed.

```python
# Example: Creating and modifying a list
fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
print(fruits[0])  # Output: apple
fruits[1] = "blueberry"
print(fruits)  # Output: ['apple', 'blueberry', 'cherry']
```

### Implementing Game Logic and Algorithms

By combining loops, conditional statements, and lists, you can implement complex game logic and algorithms. Let's consider an example where we use these constructs to implement a simple number guessing game.

### Example: Number Guessing Game

```python
import random

def number_guessing_game():
    target_number = random.randint(1, 100)
    guess = None

    while guess != target_number:
        guess = int(input("Guess a number between 1 and 100: "))
        
        if guess < target_number:
            print("Too low!")
        elif guess > target_number:
            print("Too high!")
        else:
            print("Congratulations! You guessed the number.")

# Run the game
number_guessing_game()
```

### Application in the Ambrosial App

In the Ambrosial app, you might need to manage lists of ingredients or implement game logic for recipe challenges. Here's an example of how you can use loops, conditional statements, and lists to handle user input and track the status of a recipe competition.

**Example: Managing Recipe Submissions**

```python
# List to store submitted recipes
recipes = []

def submit_recipe():
    recipe_name = input("Enter the name of your recipe: ")
    ingredients = input("Enter the ingredients (comma-separated): ").split(",")
    recipes.append({
        "name": recipe_name,
        "ingredients": ingredients
    })

def display_recipes():
    for recipe in recipes:
        print(f"Recipe: {recipe['name']}")
        print("Ingredients:")
        for ingredient in recipe['ingredients']:
            print(f" - {ingredient}")

def recipe_competition():
    while True:
        print("1. Submit a recipe")
        print("2. Display all recipes")
        print("3. Exit")
        choice = input("Choose an option: ")

        if choice == "1":
            submit_recipe()
        elif choice == "2":
            display_recipes()
        elif choice == "3":
            break
        else:
            print("Invalid choice. Please try again.")

# Run the recipe competition
recipe_competition()
```
