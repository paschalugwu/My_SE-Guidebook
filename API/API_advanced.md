        data = response.json()
        process_data(data)
        
        # Check for termination condition (e.g., end of data)
        if not is_end_of_data(data):
            # Make recursive call with updated parameters
            next_page_url = get_next_page_url(data)
            fetch_data(next_page_url, params)
    else:
        print("Error:", response.status_code)

def process_data(data):
    # Process and display the retrieved data
    for item in data:
        print(item)

def is_end_of_data(data):
    # Check if the end of data condition is met
    return len(data) == 0

def get_next_page_url(data):
    # Extract URL for the next page from the response data
    return data.get("next_page_url")

# Example usage
fetch_data("https://api.example.com/data")
```

### Real-World Application

Recursive API calls are commonly used in various real-world scenarios, such as:
