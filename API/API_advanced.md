```python
import requests

def fetch_data(page_number, page_size):
    url = f"https://api.example.com/data?page={page_number}&size={page_size}"
    response = requests.get(url)
    return response.json()

def process_data(data):
    # Process and display the retrieved data
    for item in data:
        print(item)

def main():
    page_number = 1
    page_size = 10
    
    while True:
        data = fetch_data(page_number, page_size)
        process_data(data)
        
        # Check if there are additional pages
        if len(data) < page_size:
            break  # No more pages available, exit the loop
        
        page_number += 1

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

## Making Recursive API Calls

A recursive API call is a technique used to repeatedly call an API endpoint within the same function until a certain condition is met. This approach is commonly used when dealing with hierarchical data structures or when paginating through large datasets. Let's explore how to make a recursive API call step by step.

### 1. Define the Recursive Function

Start by defining a function that will make the API call. This function will call itself recursively until a termination condition is met.

### 2. Make the API Call

Within the recursive function, make the API call to the desired endpoint. Process the response data as needed.

### 3. Check for Termination Condition

Before making each recursive call, check if the termination condition has been met. This condition could be reaching the end of the data or a specific limit set by the application.

### 4. Recur

If the termination condition is not met, make another recursive call to the API function. Pass any necessary parameters to the function to fetch the next set of data.

### Example Code Snippet

Here's an example of how to make a recursive API call using Python:

```python
import requests

def fetch_data(url, params=None):
    response = requests.get(url, params=params)
    
    if response.status_code == 200:
        data = response.json()
        process_data(data)
        
        # Check for termination condition (e.g., end of data)
        if not is_end_of_data(data):
            # Make recursive call with updated parameters
            next_page_url = get_next_page_url(data)
            fetch_data(next_page_url, params)
    else:
        print("Error:", response.status_code)

def process_data(data):
    # Process and display the retrieved data
    for item in data:
        print(item)

def is_end_of_data(data):
    # Check if the end of data condition is met
    return len(data) == 0

def get_next_page_url(data):
    # Extract URL for the next page from the response data
    return data.get("next_page_url")

# Example usage
fetch_data("https://api.example.com/data")
```

### Real-World Application

Recursive API calls are commonly used in various real-world scenarios, such as:

- Fetching hierarchical data structures, such as category trees or organizational charts, from APIs.
- Paginating through large datasets returned by APIs to retrieve all available data.
- Traversing nested resources, such as comments on a post or replies to a comment, in social media platforms' APIs.

By implementing recursive API calls, developers can efficiently retrieve and process data from APIs, ensuring optimal performance and functionality in their applications.

In conclusion, making recursive API calls is a powerful technique for software engineers to retrieve and process data from APIs in a structured and efficient manner. By following the steps outlined above and leveraging recursive function calls, developers can navigate through hierarchical data structures and paginated datasets seamlessly, enhancing the capabilities of their applications.

## Sorting a Dictionary by Value

Python's `sorted()` function can be used to sort iterable objects, such as lists or dictionaries. When sorting dictionaries, we can use the `key` parameter to specify a function that extracts the value by which to sort.

### 3. Specify Sorting Criteria

Define the sorting criteria based on the values of the dictionary. This can be achieved by providing a lambda function to the `key` parameter of the `sorted()` function.

### 4. Iterate Through Sorted Items

After sorting the dictionary by value, iterate through the sorted items to access the key-value pairs in the desired order.

### Example Code Snippet

Here's an example of how to sort a dictionary by value in Python:

```python
# Sample dictionary
my_dict = {'apple': 5, 'banana': 2, 'orange': 8, 'grape': 3}

# Sort the dictionary by value in ascending order
sorted_dict = dict(sorted(my_dict.items(), key=lambda item: item[1]))

# Print the sorted dictionary
for key, value in sorted_dict.items():
    print(key, ':', value)
```

### Real-World Application

Sorting a dictionary by value is useful in various real-world scenarios, such as:

- Ranking items based on popularity, frequency, or importance.
