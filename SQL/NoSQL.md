## Understanding NoSQL

### What NoSQL Means

NoSQL stands for "Not Only SQL." It refers to a variety of database systems that are designed to handle large volumes of data, complex data structures, and flexible data storage requirements. Unlike traditional SQL databases, NoSQL databases do not rely on a fixed table schema and use different data models, such as document, key-value, column-family, and graph formats.

### Types of NoSQL Databases

1. **Document Databases**
   - Store data in documents similar to JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) objects.
   - Each document can have a different structure.
   - Examples: MongoDB, CouchDB.

2. **Key-Value Stores**
   - Store data as a collection of key-value pairs.
   - Highly efficient for simple lookups and storing session information.
   - Examples: Redis, DynamoDB.

3. **Column-Family Stores**
   - Store data in columns rather than rows.
   - Designed for handling large volumes of data across many servers.
   - Examples: Cassandra, HBase.

4. **Graph Databases**
   - Store data in graph structures with nodes, edges, and properties.
   - Ideal for applications with complex relationships between data points.
   - Examples: Neo4j, OrientDB.

### Key Features of NoSQL Databases

1. **Scalability**
   - Designed to scale out horizontally by distributing data across multiple servers.

2. **Flexibility**
   - Schema-less design allows for easy modifications and varied data structures.

3. **Performance**
   - Optimized for specific use cases, such as read-heavy or write-heavy operations.

4. **Distributed Computing**
   - Data is distributed across multiple nodes to ensure high availability and fault tolerance.

### Real-World Application of NoSQL Databases

#### Example Project: E-commerce Platform

Imagine you're developing an e-commerce platform. Here's how you might use different types of NoSQL databases:

1. **User Data**: Use a document database like MongoDB to store user profiles. Each user profile can have a different structure, making it easy to store various user attributes without a fixed schema.

   ```json
   {
     "user_id": "12345",
     "name": "John Doe",
     "email": "john.doe@example.com",
     "purchase_history": [
       {"item_id": "001", "date": "2023-01-01", "amount": 59.99},
       {"item_id": "002", "date": "2023-02-15", "amount": 29.99}
     ]
   }
   ```

2. **Product Catalog**: Use a key-value store like Redis to cache product information for quick access. Each product ID serves as a key, and the product details are the value.

   ```json
   {
     "product_id": "001",
     "name": "Wireless Mouse",
     "price": 25.99,
     "stock": 150
   }
   ```

3. **Order Processing**: Use a column-family store like Cassandra to manage order transactions. This allows you to handle high write throughput and store large volumes of order data efficiently.

   ```sql
   CREATE TABLE orders (
     order_id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
     user_id TEXT,
     product_id TEXT,
     quantity INT,
     order_date TIMESTAMP
   );
   ```

4. **Recommendation Engine**: Use a graph database like Neo4j to analyze customer behavior and provide product recommendations based on user interactions and purchase history.

   ```cypher
   MATCH (user:User)-[:PURCHASED]->(product:Product)
   WHERE user.user_id = "12345"
   RETURN product.name
   ```

## Understanding the Difference Between SQL and NoSQL

### SQL (Structured Query Language)

SQL databases are relational databases that use structured query language (SQL) for defining and manipulating data. They are designed to store data in tables, which consist of rows and columns. Each table has a fixed schema, meaning the structure of the data is predefined.

### Characteristics of SQL Databases

1. **Schema-based Structure**
   - Data is stored in tables with predefined schemas.
   - Each table consists of rows and columns, with each row representing a record and each column representing a field.

2. **ACID Compliance**
   - Ensures Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, and Durability.
   - Transactions are reliable and adhere to these properties.

3. **Joins and Relationships**
   - Supports complex queries and joins to combine data from multiple tables.
   - Establishes relationships between tables using foreign keys.

4. **Examples**
   - MySQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle, SQL Server.

### NoSQL (Not Only SQL)

NoSQL databases are non-relational and are designed to handle large volumes of unstructured or semi-structured data. They offer flexibility in data storage and retrieval, and are optimized for performance and scalability.

### Characteristics of NoSQL Databases

1. **Schema-less Design**
   - Data can be stored without a fixed schema.
   - Allows for flexible and dynamic data structures.

2. **BASE Compliance**
   - Stands for Basically Available, Soft state, Eventual consistency.
   - Prioritizes availability and partition tolerance over strict consistency.

3. **Various Data Models**
   - Document: Stores data in JSON-like documents (e.g., MongoDB).
   - Key-Value: Stores data as key-value pairs (e.g., Redis).
   - Column-Family: Stores data in columns (e.g., Cassandra).
   - Graph: Stores data in nodes and edges (e.g., Neo4j).

4. **Examples**
   - MongoDB, Redis, Cassandra, Neo4j.

### Key Differences Between SQL and NoSQL

1. **Data Model**
   - **SQL**: Uses tables with rows and columns.
   - **NoSQL**: Uses various data models (document, key-value, column-family, graph).

2. **Schema**
   - **SQL**: Fixed schema, predefined structure.
   - **NoSQL**: Schema-less, flexible structure.

3. **Transactions**
   - **SQL**: ACID compliance for reliable transactions.
   - **NoSQL**: BASE compliance, focuses on availability and partition tolerance.

4. **Scalability**
   - **SQL**: Vertical scaling (increasing resources on a single server).
   - **NoSQL**: Horizontal scaling (adding more servers to handle data).

5. **Use Cases**
   - **SQL**: Suitable for complex queries and transactions, structured data.
   - **NoSQL**: Suitable for large volumes of unstructured data, real-time web applications, and big data.

### Real-World Application Example

#### SQL: Inventory Management System

An inventory management system for a retail store can use a SQL database to manage product information, stock levels, and transactions. The structured nature and ACID compliance ensure reliable and accurate inventory tracking.

```sql
CREATE TABLE products (
    product_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    name VARCHAR(100),
    price DECIMAL(10, 2),
    stock INT
);

INSERT INTO products (product_id, name, price, stock) VALUES
(1, 'Laptop', 999.99, 50),
(2, 'Mouse', 19.99, 150);

SELECT * FROM products WHERE stock > 0;
```

#### NoSQL: Social Media Platform

A social media platform can use a NoSQL database to store user profiles, posts, and interactions. The flexible schema allows for easy addition of new features and data types, while horizontal scaling ensures the system can handle a large number of users and interactions.

```json
{
    "user_id": "u123",
    "name": "Jane Doe",
    "posts": [
        {"post_id": "p1", "content": "Hello, world!", "likes": 100},
        {"post_id": "p2", "content": "NoSQL is awesome!", "likes": 200}
    ]
}
```

## Understanding ACID in Databases

### What is ACID?

ACID stands for Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, and Durability. These are a set of properties that ensure reliable processing of database transactions. A transaction is a sequence of one or more database operations (such as insert, update, delete) that are executed as a single unit. ACID properties guarantee that these operations are processed reliably.

### ACID Properties Explained

1. **Atomicity**
   - Ensures that all operations within a transaction are completed successfully. If any operation fails, the entire transaction fails and the database remains unchanged.
   - Example: Transferring money between two bank accounts should either complete fully or not at all.

   ```sql
   START TRANSACTION;
   UPDATE accounts SET balance = balance - 100 WHERE account_id = 1;
   UPDATE accounts SET balance = balance + 100 WHERE account_id = 2;
   COMMIT; -- or ROLLBACK if any operation fails
   ```

2. **Consistency**
   - Ensures that a transaction takes the database from one valid state to another, maintaining database invariants (such as unique constraints, foreign keys, etc.).
   - Example: Ensuring that account balances never go negative after a transaction.

   ```sql
   START TRANSACTION;
   UPDATE accounts SET balance = balance - 100 WHERE account_id = 1 AND balance >= 100;
   UPDATE accounts SET balance = balance + 100 WHERE account_id = 2;
   COMMIT; -- Ensures no balance goes negative
   ```

3. **Isolation**
   - Ensures that transactions are processed independently and transparently. The intermediate state of a transaction is invisible to other transactions.
   - Example: Two transactions transferring money should not interfere with each other.

   ```sql
   START TRANSACTION;
   -- Other transactions cannot see the changes until the current transaction is committed.
   ```

4. **Durability**
   - Ensures that once a transaction is committed, it remains so, even in the event of a system failure. The changes made by the transaction are permanently recorded.
   - Example: After a successful transaction, the updated balances are saved even if the system crashes.

   ```sql
   START TRANSACTION;
   UPDATE accounts SET balance = balance - 100 WHERE account_id = 1;
   UPDATE accounts SET balance = balance + 100 WHERE account_id = 2;
   COMMIT; -- Changes are permanently recorded
   ```

### Real-World Application of ACID

#### Example Project: Online Banking System

In an online banking system, ACID properties ensure that all transactions are processed reliably and accurately. Consider a scenario where a user transfers money from their savings account to their checking account:

1. **Atomicity**: The entire transfer operation either completes successfully or fails completely. If the deduction from the savings account fails, the addition to the checking account does not occur.

2. **Consistency**: The database ensures that the total balance remains consistent. Constraints like no negative balances are maintained.

3. **Isolation**: Multiple users transferring money simultaneously do not affect each other's transactions. Each transfer appears isolated.

4. **Durability**: Once the transfer is completed and the transaction is committed, the changes remain even if the server crashes immediately after.

## Understanding Document Storage

### What is Document Storage?

Document storage refers to a type of NoSQL database that stores data in documents. These documents are often in JSON (JavaScript Object Notation), BSON (Binary JSON), or XML format. Each document is a self-contained unit that can have a flexible and dynamic schema, allowing for a variety of data types and structures.

### Characteristics of Document Storage

1. **Schema Flexibility**
   - Unlike traditional SQL databases, document storage does not require a predefined schema. This means that each document can have a different structure, making it easy to store varied and evolving data.

2. **Hierarchical Data Storage**
   - Documents can contain nested structures, allowing for a more natural representation of hierarchical data compared to flat table structures.

3. **Efficient Data Retrieval**
   - Designed for quick read and write operations. Indexing mechanisms ensure efficient querying of documents.

4. **Scalability**
   - Document databases are designed to scale horizontally, distributing data across multiple servers to handle large volumes of data and high traffic.

### Common Use Cases

1. **Content Management Systems (CMS)**
   - Stores various types of content (articles, images, videos) with different structures.
   
2. **E-commerce Platforms**
   - Manages product catalogs, user profiles, and orders, each with potentially different attributes.

3. **Mobile and Web Applications**
   - Stores user-generated content, preferences, and session data dynamically.

### Examples of Document Databases

1. **MongoDB**
   - A widely used document database that stores data in BSON format. It provides powerful query capabilities and indexing.

2. **CouchDB**
   - Stores data in JSON format and uses MapReduce for queries. It is known for its offline-first design and synchronization capabilities.

### Real-World Application Example

#### Example Project: Product Catalog for an E-commerce Platform

Imagine you're developing an e-commerce platform where you need to store information about various products. Each product can have different attributes such as name, price, description, category, and specifications.

Using a document database like MongoDB, you can store each product as a document. This allows you to easily add new attributes without modifying a fixed schema.

##### Example Document for a Product

```json
{
  "product_id": "12345",
  "name": "Smartphone",
  "brand": "TechBrand",
  "price": 299.99,
  "category": "Electronics",
  "specifications": {
    "screen_size": "6.1 inches",
    "battery": "3000 mAh",
    "camera": "12 MP"
  },
  "reviews": [
    {"user": "user1", "rating": 5, "comment": "Great phone!"},
    {"user": "user2", "rating": 4, "comment": "Good value for money."}
  ]
}
```

##### Example Code Snippet to Insert a Document in MongoDB

```javascript
const { MongoClient } = require('mongodb');

async function main() {
  const uri = "your_mongodb_connection_string";
  const client = new MongoClient(uri);

  try {
    await client.connect();
    const database = client.db('ecommerce');
    const products = database.collection('products');

    const product = {
      product_id: "12345",
      name: "Smartphone",
      brand: "TechBrand",
      price: 299.99,
      category: "Electronics",
      specifications: {
        screen_size: "6.1 inches",
        battery: "3000 mAh",
        camera: "12 MP"
      },
      reviews: [
        {"user": "user1", "rating": 5, "comment": "Great phone!"},
        {"user": "user2", "rating": 4, "comment": "Good value for money."}
      ]
    };

    const result = await products.insertOne(product);
    console.log(`New product inserted with the following id: ${result.insertedId}`);
  } finally {
    await client.close();
  }
}

main().catch(console.error);
```

## Understanding NoSQL Types

### NoSQL Database Types

NoSQL databases are designed to handle large volumes of unstructured or semi-structured data, offering flexibility and scalability that traditional SQL databases may lack. There are several types of NoSQL databases, each suited to specific types of data and use cases.

### 1. Document Stores

Document stores, or document-oriented databases, store data in documents, typically using JSON, BSON, or XML formats. Each document contains key-value pairs and can have a flexible schema.

- **Examples**: MongoDB, CouchDB
- **Use Cases**: Content management systems, e-commerce product catalogs, user profiles

#### Example Code Snippet (MongoDB)

```javascript
const { MongoClient } = require('mongodb');

async function main() {
    const uri = "your_mongodb_connection_string";
    const client = new MongoClient(uri);

    try {
        await client.connect();
        const database = client.db('ecommerce');
        const products = database.collection('products');

        const product = {
            product_id: "12345",
            name: "Smartphone",
            brand: "TechBrand",
            price: 299.99,
            category: "Electronics",
            specifications: {
                screen_size: "6.1 inches",
                battery: "3000 mAh",
                camera: "12 MP"
            },
            reviews: [
                {"user": "user1", "rating": 5, "comment": "Great phone!"},
                {"user": "user2", "rating": 4, "comment": "Good value for money."}
            ]
        };

        const result = await products.insertOne(product);
        console.log(`New product inserted with the following id: ${result.insertedId}`);
    } finally {
        await client.close();
    }
}

main().catch(console.error);
```

### 2. Key-Value Stores

Key-value stores store data as a collection of key-value pairs. Each key is unique and maps to a specific value, which can be a simple data type or a more complex object.

- **Examples**: Redis, DynamoDB
- **Use Cases**: Caching, session management, real-time data processing

#### Example Code Snippet (Redis)

```python
import redis

# Connect to Redis server
client = redis.StrictRedis(host='localhost', port=6379, db=0)

# Set key-value pairs
client.set('username', 'alice')
client.set('age', 30)

# Get values by keys
username = client.get('username')
age = client.get('age')

print(f'Username: {username.decode("utf-8")}')
print(f'Age: {age.decode("utf-8")}')
```

### 3. Column-Family Stores

Column-family stores, also known as wide-column stores, organize data into columns and rows, but group columns into families based on related data. This allows for efficient reading and writing of data by column.

- **Examples**: Cassandra, HBase
- **Use Cases**: Time-series data, big data analytics, event logging

#### Example Code Snippet (Cassandra)

```sql
CREATE KEYSPACE ecommerce WITH REPLICATION = {
    'class': 'SimpleStrategy',
    'replication_factor': 1
};

CREATE TABLE ecommerce.products (
    product_id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
    name TEXT,
    brand TEXT,
    price DECIMAL,
    category TEXT
);

INSERT INTO ecommerce.products (product_id, name, brand, price, category)
VALUES (uuid(), 'Smartphone', 'TechBrand', 299.99, 'Electronics');

SELECT * FROM ecommerce.products;
```

### 4. Graph Databases

Graph databases store data as nodes, edges, and properties, representing entities, their relationships, and attributes, respectively. This structure is ideal for traversing and querying complex relationships.

- **Examples**: Neo4j, Amazon Neptune
- **Use Cases**: Social networks, recommendation engines, fraud detection

#### Example Code Snippet (Neo4j)

```python
from neo4j import GraphDatabase

class App:

    def __init__(self, uri, user, password):
        self.driver = GraphDatabase.driver(uri, auth=(user, password))

    def close(self):
        self.driver.close()

    def create_friendship(self, person1_name, person2_name):
        with self.driver.session() as session:
            session.write_transaction(self._create_and_return_friendship, person1_name, person2_name)

    @staticmethod
    def _create_and_return_friendship(tx, person1_name, person2_name):
        query = (
            "MERGE (p1:Person {name: $person1_name}) "

## Benefits of a NoSQL Database

NoSQL databases offer several advantages over traditional SQL databases, particularly when dealing with large volumes of unstructured or semi-structured data. Here are some key benefits of using NoSQL databases:

### 1. Schema Flexibility

- **Description**: NoSQL databases do not require a fixed schema, allowing you to store data with different structures in the same database.
- **Benefit**: This flexibility makes it easier to adapt to changing data requirements and simplifies the development process.

#### Example
In a NoSQL database, you can store user profiles where each user can have different attributes:
```json
{
  "user_id": "1",
  "name": "Alice",
  "email": "alice@example.com",
  "preferences": {
    "theme": "dark",
    "notifications": true
  }
}
```
```json
{
  "user_id": "2",
  "name": "Bob",
  "email": "bob@example.com",
  "address": "123 Main St"
}
```

### 2. Horizontal Scalability

- **Description**: NoSQL databases are designed to scale out by distributing data across multiple servers, also known as horizontal scaling.
- **Benefit**: This allows them to handle large amounts of data and high traffic loads more efficiently than vertical scaling (adding more power to a single server).

#### Example
In a distributed NoSQL database like Cassandra, data is spread across multiple nodes, ensuring high availability and fault tolerance.

### 3. High Performance

- **Description**: NoSQL databases are optimized for fast read and write operations.
- **Benefit**: They can handle high volumes of data and provide low-latency access, making them suitable for real-time applications.

#### Example
Redis, a key-value store, is often used for caching to speed up data retrieval in web applications.

### 4. Handle Unstructured Data

- **Description**: NoSQL databases can efficiently store and query unstructured data such as text, images, videos, and more.
- **Benefit**: This makes them ideal for applications like social media, content management, and big data analytics.

#### Example
In a document store like MongoDB, you can store and query large text documents, images, and other multimedia files.

### 5. Flexible Data Models

- **Description**: NoSQL databases support various data models, including key-value, document, column-family, and graph.
- **Benefit**: This flexibility allows you to choose the best data model for your specific application requirements.

#### Example
Neo4j, a graph database, is used to store and traverse complex relationships in social networks or recommendation engines.

### 6. Cost-Effectiveness

- **Description**: NoSQL databases can run on commodity hardware and are often open-source.
- **Benefit**: This reduces costs compared to traditional SQL databases that may require expensive hardware and licenses.

#### Example
Many NoSQL databases like MongoDB and Cassandra are available in open-source versions, reducing software licensing costs.

### Real-World Application Example

#### Example Project: Social Media Platform

A social media platform can benefit greatly from a NoSQL database due to its need to handle large volumes of diverse data (user profiles, posts, comments, likes) and high read/write loads.

- **Schema Flexibility**: User profiles, posts, and comments can have varying attributes.
- **Horizontal Scalability**: The platform can scale out to handle millions of users.
- **High Performance**: Fast access to user feeds and real-time updates.
- **Handling Unstructured Data**: Storing text posts, images, and videos.
- **Flexible Data Models**: Using a graph database for social connections and recommendations.

## How to Query Information from a NoSQL Database

Querying data from a NoSQL database varies depending on the type of NoSQL database you are using. Unlike SQL databases that use the SQL query language, NoSQL databases have different methods and languages for querying data. Below, we'll explore how to query information from different types of NoSQL databases with examples.

### 1. Document Stores (e.g., MongoDB)

Document stores use collections of documents (similar to JSON objects). MongoDB is a popular document store.

#### Example Code Snippet (MongoDB)

Using the MongoDB query language in JavaScript:

```javascript
const { MongoClient } = require('mongodb');

async function main() {
    const uri = "your_mongodb_connection_string";
    const client = new MongoClient(uri);

    try {
        await client.connect();
        const database = client.db('ecommerce');
        const products = database.collection('products');

        // Query for products in the "Electronics" category
        const query = { category: "Electronics" };
        const options = {
            sort: { price: -1 },
            projection: { _id: 0, name: 1, price: 1 }
        };

        const cursor = products.find(query, options);
        const results = await cursor.toArray();

        if (results.length > 0) {
            results.forEach((result, i) => {
                console.log(`${i + 1}. Name: ${result.name}, Price: ${result.price}`);
            });
        } else {
            console.log("No products found in the 'Electronics' category");
        }
    } finally {
        await client.close();
    }
}

main().catch(console.error);
```

### 2. Key-Value Stores (e.g., Redis)

Key-value stores use a simple key-value pair for data storage. Redis is a popular key-value store.

#### Example Code Snippet (Redis)

Using Redis commands in Python:

```python
import redis

client = redis.StrictRedis(host='localhost', port=6379, db=0)

# Store some key-value pairs
client.set('product:1001', 'Laptop')
client.set('product:1002', 'Smartphone')
client.set('product:1003', 'Tablet')

# Retrieve values by keys
product1 = client.get('product:1001')
product2 = client.get('product:1002')

print(f'Product 1001: {product1.decode("utf-8")}')
print(f'Product 1002: {product2.decode("utf-8")}')
```

### 3. Column-Family Stores (e.g., Cassandra)

Column-family stores use tables with rows and columns but group columns into families. Cassandra is a well-known column-family store.

#### Example Code Snippet (Cassandra)

Using CQL (Cassandra Query Language):

```sql
-- Create keyspace and table
CREATE KEYSPACE ecommerce WITH REPLICATION = {
    'class': 'SimpleStrategy',
    'replication_factor': 1
};

CREATE TABLE ecommerce.products (
    product_id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
    name TEXT,
    brand TEXT,
    price DECIMAL,
    category TEXT
);

-- Insert data
INSERT INTO ecommerce.products (product_id, name, brand, price, category)
VALUES (uuid(), 'Smartphone', 'TechBrand', 299.99, 'Electronics');

-- Query data
SELECT name, price FROM ecommerce.products WHERE category = 'Electronics';
```

### 4. Graph Databases (e.g., Neo4j)

Graph databases use nodes, edges, and properties to represent and store data. Neo4j is a popular graph database.

#### Example Code Snippet (Neo4j)

Using Cypher (Neo4j's query language):

```python
from neo4j import GraphDatabase

class App:

    def __init__(self, uri, user, password):
        self.driver = GraphDatabase.driver(uri, auth=(user, password))

    def close(self):
        self.driver.close()

    def find_friends(self, name):
        with self.driver.session() as session:
            result = session.run(
                "MATCH (p:Person)-[:FRIEND]->(friend) WHERE p.name = $name RETURN friend.name AS friend",
                name=name
            )
            for record in result:
                print(record["friend"])

app = App("bolt://localhost:7687", "neo4j", "password")
app.find_friends("Alice")
app.close()
```

## Inserting, Updating, and Deleting Information from a NoSQL Database

Manipulating data in a NoSQL database involves different methods compared to traditional SQL databases. Each type of NoSQL database has its own approach to inserting, updating, and deleting data. Let's explore how these operations are performed in various types of NoSQL databases with example code snippets.

### 1. Document Stores (e.g., MongoDB)

Document stores use collections of documents (e.g., JSON objects) and are flexible in how data is structured.

#### Example Code Snippets (MongoDB)

**Inserting Data:**
```javascript
const { MongoClient } = require('mongodb');

async function insertDocument() {
    const uri = "your_mongodb_connection_string";
    const client = new MongoClient(uri);

    try {
        await client.connect();
        const database = client.db('ecommerce');
        const products = database.collection('products');

        // Insert a new product document
        const product = {
            name: 'Laptop',
            brand: 'TechBrand',
            price: 899.99,
            category: 'Electronics'
        };

        const result = await products.insertOne(product);
        console.log(`New product added with ID: ${result.insertedId}`);
    } finally {
        await client.close();
    }
}

insertDocument().catch(console.error);
```

**Updating Data:**
```javascript
const { MongoClient, ObjectId } = require('mongodb');

async function updateDocument(productId, updateFields) {
    const uri = "your_mongodb_connection_string";
    const client = new MongoClient(uri);

    try {
        await client.connect();
        const database = client.db('ecommerce');
        const products = database.collection('products');

        // Update product document
        const result = await products.updateOne(
            { _id: ObjectId(productId) },
            { $set: updateFields }
        );

        console.log(`${result.modifiedCount} product updated`);
    } finally {
        await client.close();
    }
}

// Example usage
updateDocument('609bedc6813e9e302a2668d5', { price: 999.99 }).catch(console.error);
```

**Deleting Data:**
```javascript
const { MongoClient, ObjectId } = require('mongodb');

async function deleteDocument(productId) {
    const uri = "your_mongodb_connection_string";
    const client = new MongoClient(uri);

    try {
        await client.connect();
        const database = client.db('ecommerce');
        const products = database.collection('products');

        // Delete product document
        const result = await products.deleteOne({ _id: ObjectId(productId) });

        console.log(`${result.deletedCount} product deleted`);
    } finally {
        await client.close();
    }
}

// Example usage
deleteDocument('609bedc6813e9e302a2668d5').catch(console.error);
```

### 2. Key-Value Stores (e.g., Redis)

Key-value stores allow simple operations with keys and their associated values.

#### Example Code Snippets (Redis)

**Inserting Data:**
```python
import redis

client = redis.StrictRedis(host='localhost', port=6379, db=0)

# Insert key-value pairs
client.set('product:1001', 'Laptop')
client.set('product:1002', 'Smartphone')
```

**Updating Data:**
```python
# Update value for a key
client.set('product:1001', 'Gaming Laptop')
```

**Deleting Data:**
```python
# Delete a key
client.delete('product:1002')
```

### 3. Column-Family Stores (e.g., Cassandra)

Column-family stores use tables with rows and columns, grouped into column families.

#### Example Code Snippets (Cassandra)

**Inserting Data:**
```sql
INSERT INTO ecommerce.products (product_id, name, brand, price, category)
VALUES (uuid(), 'Smartphone', 'TechBrand', 299.99, 'Electronics');
```

SET price = 329.99
WHERE product_id = uuid();
```

**Deleting Data:**
```sql
DELETE FROM ecommerce.products
WHERE product_id = uuid();
```

### 4. Graph Databases (e.g., Neo4j)

Graph databases store nodes, relationships, and properties.

#### Example Code Snippets (Neo4j)

**Inserting Data:**
```python
from neo4j import GraphDatabase

class App:

    def __init__(self, uri, user, password):
        self.driver = GraphDatabase.driver(uri, auth=(user, password))

    def close(self):
        self.driver.close()

    def create_friendship(self, person1, person2):
        with self.driver.session() as session:
            session.run(
                "MERGE (p1:Person {name: $person1}) "
                "MERGE (p2:Person {name: $person2}) "
                "MERGE (p1)-[:FRIEND]->(p2)",
                person1=person1, person2=person2
            )

app = App("bolt://localhost:7687", "neo4j", "password")
app.create_friendship("Alice", "Bob")
app.close()
```

**Updating Data:**
```python
from neo4j import GraphDatabase

class App:

    def __init__(self, uri, user, password):
        self.driver = GraphDatabase.driver(uri, auth=(user, password))

    def close(self):
        self.driver.close()

    def update_person(self, person_name, new_name):
        with self.driver.session() as session:
            session.run(
                "MATCH (p:Person {name: $person_name}) "
                "SET p.name = $new_name",
                person_name=person_name, new_name=new_name
            )

## Using MongoDB

MongoDB is a popular NoSQL database that stores data in flexible, JSON-like documents. It's widely used in modern web applications for its scalability and ease of use. Below, we'll explore the basics of using MongoDB with example code snippets.

### Connecting to MongoDB

To use MongoDB in your application, you first need to connect to a MongoDB server using a connection string. This allows your application to interact with the database.

#### Example Code Snippet (Node.js)

```javascript
const { MongoClient } = require('mongodb');

// Connection URI
const uri = "mongodb://localhost:27017/mydatabase";

// Create a new MongoClient
const client = new MongoClient(uri, { useNewUrlParser: true, useUnifiedTopology: true });

async function main() {
    try {
        // Connect the client to the server
        await client.connect();

        console.log("Connected to MongoDB");

        // Perform operations here...

    } finally {
        // Close the connection when finished
        await client.close();
        console.log("Connection to MongoDB closed");
    }
}

main().catch(console.error);
```

### Creating and Using Collections

MongoDB stores data in collections, which are analogous to tables in relational databases. Each collection contains multiple documents, which are JSON-like objects.

#### Example Code Snippet (Node.js)

```javascript
const { MongoClient } = require('mongodb');

async function main() {
    const uri = "mongodb://localhost:27017/mydatabase";
